              "['We found Van Gogh&acute;s story so interesting and were able to see it on the screen as well as follow his paintings - all having a story to tell One of the best museums in the world. Tastefully set out with amazing art. We loved this museum and encourage anyone to put it on the top of their list. This is an experience that everyone should see. A girl so young reaching out through her writing to the whole world. We wondered if she would have had any idea that her writing would reach so far and wide. It was a quick checkin to get the tickets and off we were in the building. A lot of concrete walls and stuff first - a little boring. Then we entered big room with brewing boilers etc. which was much more interesting. Then a ride on Heineken Experience, tasting beer, some fun with recording videos, photos and sending them to our friends -> to the bar for free 2 glasses/person and my wife doesn&acute;t drink beer -> so 4 for me :) And we were through! Expensive shop at the end, but we got 10% discount as we played rock/scissors/paper online game for like 30min to finally win and get the discount.\\n\\nThen we also went to the Heineken shop in the city (very near Rembrandt square) as you get a free gift with bracelet from Heineken Museum. We got free Heineken Sunglasses, good enough.\\n\\nCompared to example Guinness brewery in Dublin it was not so entertaining, but still worth a visit of course! Arriving at the Anne Frank House we saw this loooooong line of people. That was just terrifying and thus we just took pictures from outside. Then when going closeby again I notices another doors (next door from big line) where it was written \"ring if you have online ticket\". There was not a single person on this door! So DO GET THE TICKETS ONLINE and skip the sheep waiting in line for probably more than an hour! Tried to book online but no tickets left, so thought we would skip this... after talking to fellow tourists we realised we would HAVE to do it, so, we bit the bullet and joined the end of the not so long (as we thought) queue. Everyone was friendly and chatting and resigned to a long wait, because we had all heard it was worth it. And it is.\\nYou cannot go to Amsterdam and not see Anne Frank house, that`s all I can say. We had seen this impressive building and the replica ship \"Amsterdam\" from a canal boat trip the previous evening and thought we would walk up the next day to perhaps look around the ship... Didn`t think I was that interested in maritime history... Well, we paid our 15 euros each and went straight to the replica ship, which was really well designed, interesting and fun (especially the virtual firing of the cannons!) and worth the entrance money alone, in my opinion. But, we have paid for more, so let`s have a look at the rest...\\nSo glad we did, in a very spacious, well designed building, there were interesting and exciting interactive exhibits and experiences, yes, maritime history and yes, models and paintings of boats but also a history of whaling and a very moving social history.And as for the sea voyage \"ride\", well, not to be missed, loved the twist at the end!\\nAlthough I thought the Rijksmuseum was very impressive and I enjoyed their exhibits, I actually enjoyed this experience more, as it was very calm and unhurried with lots of time to enjoy the interactives, it seemed good for children as well with lots of buttons to press, and a fun climbing area in the ship, oh, and the cafe was good as well! This was my second time in Amsterdam and by all means, the better time. It was due to the fact that I learned more about the fascinating city in an animated and engaging way from Paul Russell. That guy is legit and knows his stuff, but not only that, he is funny and fun. The tour takes you through the &acute;must sees&acute; and this was exactly what my husband and I needed cos we only had less than a day to experience a bit of Amsterdam&acute;s flair. Doing this tour was the highlight of the day. Beats wandering about with a static map trying to see everything. This is seriously the way to go if you want Amsterdam in a nutshell with some sass. You pay the guide a tip at the end, which is fair and only if you feel that his/her services were worth it. And Paul&acute;s definitely were. I love maritime history and this was a very interesting museum. Beautifully appointed in an old naval warehouse, the exhibitions were really different, interactive and innovative compared to other places I&acute;ve been - especially the instrument room with the solar system all around. The replica Amsterdam ship is good fun and there were lots of things for kids to be interested in too. My only reason for not giving this a 5 score was because of the whaling exhibition - I totally understand it&acute;s part of history etc however as a non-Dutch person, the exhibit did not adequately get across to me why this was such a feature and then the link to &acute;Save the Whales&acute; seemed a bit stuck on at the end rather than a journey of how things have changed, whilst acknowledging the important part this played in history. But this may just be my own personal interpretation, not everyone&acute;s. The Atlas Room is very impressive too. We loved it here. So much so that we visited twice in two days! The staff are excellent and service is very attentive. This is a great place to stop for lunch/snacks and a beer or a juice. Great history, ambiance and interest... and a resident cat as well. The broodje gezond is highly recommended for lunch. A very moving and well thought out museum. There is always a queue, understandably, as there is only so much space in the premises. If you are organised however, you can book your tickets in advance on line. Otherwise the queues and wait can be long. It was later in the day and poor weather when we got there and waited about 45 minutes. I thought I knew Anne&acute;s story but was pleased to learn more about her as well as the other occupants. At times it was a bit busy with some people rushing through it and I wanted to take a little more time over it, which you could do but perhaps felt a little rushed at times given the volume of visitors. Essential experience though. The Hortus Botanicus is NOT your average tourist attraction. It is a botanical garden, and a rather intellectual one at that. ALL plants are \"natural\" varieties that occur in the wild, so there are no fancy hibrids with exotic blossoms. You should think of this as a plant museum, not a flower show. The outdoor garden is laid out on an evolutionary timeline (ferns proceeding to evergreens proceeding to decidous) with an herb garden in the middle. The information tags are only in dutch most of the time. There are enough information placards in English to get the evolutionary theme, but if you want to identify a particular plant for future reference, you will have to content yourself with the latin name and look up the english one later. There are several greenhouses, one of which is filled with butterflies (and was VERY hot in June!). The main greenhouse is very nice with 3 different climate zones and nice displays of desert, subtropical and tropical zones. One interesting feature is an elevated walkway where you can be \"in the canopy\" of the tropical forest. The tropical room was also pretty hot. The garden is not that big, but is compactly laid out. It is on one of the canals and has a few park benches throughout. I found a favorite spot by the canal among the hydrangeas where I could have sat for a long time if it had not been closing time. There is a cafe, which I did not try. The entrance fee seems a little steep for such a modest sized garden, but I am an avid gardener, so I was willing to pay it. Overall, it was a very nice break from the crush of tourists and the intensity of several days of museums. A friendly and welcoming bar with four tables outside. If you are outside of the turn of the hour you&acute;ll hear a familiar tune from the bells nearby. A great selection of well kept beer, friendly staff and decent prices. Pay for tour or skip the line otherwise line is very long. We did the walking tour and skip the line. Truly appreciated the persecution and horrible living conditions faced by people during these years. I highly recommend seeing it. I took the City Tour today. The guide and driver were nice and the bus was in good order. Nonetheless, I don&acute;t feel like I know more about the city than before. The stops at the windmill (Riekermollen, but I don&acute;t think the guide said that, I looked it up) and Foster diamonds just... Really? Those two places out of all of Amsterdam, and with so little additional information? The very nice guide very nicely didn&acute;t give a whole lot of information. Not much in multiple languages... Pass on this unless it is somehow your only option to spend three hours in Amsterdam. They have pizza nights. You take you pizza into the cinema and eat it why you watch the movie, with a beer. Kriterion is in an Amsterdam corrner where a lot has changed (huge new university campus) and a lot hasn&acute;t. Kriterion reflects different eras. Seventies of the last century mixed with contemporary technology in terms of projection. Good seats to watch the kind of movies in that match the academic atmosphere of the neighbourhood. Good place to have a drink too, whether you have bought a ticket or not. We always leave Kriterion in \"why go anywhere else\" kind of mood. There are a few very nice dinner options down the street by the way. You gotta visit it...\\n\\nThey really do cater to just about any taste...ugly...poor...rich...beautiful...you name it, they got it.\\n\\nDon&acute;t stay on the main streets, venture on the dark alleys and feel a little sinister at the same time. Anyway, you&acute;re in Amsterdam, so take a chance! Why is this not ranked the no. 1 attraction in Amsterdam?! I suppose there&acute;s no accounting for the taste of those who rank other attractions higher than this one! I just wish that I had gone two or three days in a row and done one floor each time. Still, that means I have \"1100 to 1600\" to look forward to on another trip. Normally I max out when I have been in a museum for about 1.5 hours - we spent just this on the \"Rembrandt\" floor and still wanted to do more. The restoration is absolutely superb. We didn&acute;t have the audio guide but there are extremely informative sheets dotted around various exhibits which we read in detail. My only complaint, which I explained very nicely to the guy in the shop, is that I would have loved to have been able to buy a full colour glossy guide to the museum or just the paintings. Incredibly, they don&acute;t have this - they have Rembrandt only, or they have a cheap (Euro10) paperback guide which I bought, but I would have loved to have spent Euro30 or something on a wonderful coffeetable book to take home. The guy in the shop agreed with me - shame! I am so happy I got to experience this. A must for history lovers. Make sure you pre-book your tickets. The queue was down the street, around the corner but we just walked straight in with pre-booked tickets. The Hungry Birds tour is a great way to spend a morning trying local food in Amsterdam. This tour was lots of fun & Esther was a lovely guide. We had great Dutch treats as well as other food from around the world. I would recommend this tour to anyone who likes to do something different. As cat lovers, when we saw this mentioned in our guide book we thought we had to visit. The disappointment started when we arrived. It consists of a small collection of posters and other cat artefacts in 3 rooms of a house. It was so dull that I am really struggling to remember any artefacts to mention in this review! A cat-themed pin-ball machine was the highlight of the visit. Other than that it is just a collection of pictures and ornaments, most of which are very shabby.\\n\\nThere were 2 live cats in reception as we left, but I was concerned about how thin and under-nourished they seemed. When I stroked them they were like bags of bones. They were more like strays than cared-for pets.\\n\\nI suppose you could possibly consider this to be a quirky or eccentric place for cat lovers and accept it as that. However when you compare the admission cost of EUR6 against EUR10 to get into Anne FrankвЂ™s House I think I am justified in expecting quite a lot more.\\n\\nThis place is not worth visiting and the people who run it should not be encouraged. I am even more annoyed because it was a sunny day and we wasted time indoors when we could have been enjoying the sun (with a cold beer). This didnвЂ™t really live up to expectations for me. I was already familiar with the story before visiting, so I was hoping to get a feel for the rooms that the family hid in for so long. I did see them, but shuffling through in a slow moving line of other visitors meant that it was difficult to visualise how the rooms would have been.\\n\\nIt didnвЂ™t help that all of the rooms are bare and unfurnished. AnneвЂ™s father decided that this is how they should be exhibited, for symbolic reasons. To be fair, the place is so small that it would be difficult to allow visitors to pass through if it was furnished, but it does mean you are just visiting a set of empty and bare rooms.\\n\\nWe pre-booked a visit time and went at 7pm, so we walked straight in without queuing. I certainly wouldnвЂ™t queue for some of the times people have stated on here, it really wouldnвЂ™t be worth it.',\n",
              " 'Disney has taken time to build the new cars land and it is alot of fun. The shops and rides are all in the same location as in the movie. We had an absolute blast on the new cars ride - we won the first race but lost our second race. What a blast Strolling along the walkways , looking in shops is a fun way to spend a night. There were also musical entertainers to watch. Ate in a variety to restaurants and also went to a movie. Enjoyed our time spent My favourite ride is Peter Pan&acute;s flight! The kids love astro blasters. Took in Midway mania at California Adventure for the first time. We bought a one day pass at the park entrance which was the about the same price had we bought it online before we went. The staff were very helpful & fast track worked well at no extra charge! we went on most of the attractions in one day as it wasn&acute;t too busy & the park isn&acute;t really big! I have been to California adventure 4 times now and it keeps getting better. At first, I wasn&acute;t overly Impressed with it. It certainly doesn&acute;t have the same &acute;Disney vibe&acute; as Disneyland across the way, but they are really working on it!\\n\\nIt is under going a huge transformation that once completed, I believe will make a huge difference. they have already transformed several rides to be more classic Disney and they are currently adding a huge new section to the park dedicated to the CARS films. Can&acute;t wait to see it!\\n\\nBut in the meantime I still believe it is worth the visit! California Screaming is the best coaster at the resort, tower of terror is definitely terrifying, Grizzly River Run is awesome and the new Ariels Undersea Adventure ride is alot of fun. Oh, and our personal favorite is Soarin (which in my opinion just feels better when you are at the California park!$\\n\\nYou don&acute;t want to miss Turtle talk with Crush, Tough to be a Bug 4D show or the Broadway like production of Aladdin.\\n\\nThey also have a few great places to eat (don&acute;t miss Paradise Grill!)\\n\\nWe usually spend on average a day and a half at this park. But I am sure once Cars land opens in June we will need two full days!\\n\\nit would be a mistake to skip this park all together. This was my 7th trip to Disneyland. Yes, 7th. And the magic is still going strong!\\n\\nThis time my husband and I travelled with our 7 month old son, my two brothers, my parents and my inlaws. One of the great things about Disneyland is that there is something for ALL ages!\\n\\nThe staff are incredible. It was especially evident this time with us having such a young child. The &acute;cast members&acute; as they are called went out of their way to entertain our son while we were in line-ups, to get him to smile for photos and to direct us to the best spots for our stroller for shows, etc.\\n\\nThe characters were incredibly good with our 7 months old. We never felt rushed and a few times we had characters stay longer then they were suppose to just so we could get a quick shot. I think they really understand how special those moments are to us parents.\\n\\nThe shows are spectacular. Everything from Fantasmic, to the evening Fireworks to Billy Hill & the Hillbillies. Even the street entertainers are great. The current parade, Mickeys Soundsational Parade is alot of fun. Great soundtrack and one of the best parades I have seen in my many years as a visitor.\\n\\nThe food varies based on your price range and what your are interested in. We enjoyed eating at The Hungry Bear several times because the food was good and the prices were reasonable. We also love the chicken in the Golden Horseshoe. Another great food stop is a place in Adventureland right across from the Jungle Cruise were you can get yummy meat skewers and warm pretzels.\\n\\nWe were there during Canadian spring break and I was impressed at how short some of the lines were. They really seemed to be trying to operate as many carts and vehicles as possible. And when in doubt, we just used the fastpast system (which is a ticket you can get to return to the ride at a later time with little to no line up.)\\n\\nIf you are going with young children, do yourself a favor and get a 5 day pass. You really do need that time to enjoy the park to what it deserves.\\n\\nWe are already looking forward to our next visit in 2015 when our son will be 4! Cant wait to check out CARS land! Had a great time and really needed more time. Had a three day pass and wished had more time to enjoy.\\n\\nThe FantasMic show was truly a great experience and the nightly fireworks as one of the best shows around.\\n\\nLines were better than expected apart from the Cars ride at Disney California Adventure Park so plan this part of your day. I took my husband a few years ago. He didn&acute;t really want to go. But, as he sat and admired the minute detail of the park, he said\" This really is the happiest place in the world: Nuff said. Vibrant, active and fun night life. Kids and adults had fun. Lots going on. Great for the kids. Loved the fast pass option. Wish the lines to great the characters and princesses were shorter. 30 min with a 3 and 5 year old is rough. It was okay. They offer pre-selected seating, which is nice. The seats are reasonably comfortable and they do recline a little.\\n\\nOn Tuesday and Thursday they offer $6 specials, so aim for those days. At $6 -- a bargain.\\n\\nWent to the washrooms after the show -- filthy and no towels.\\n\\nThe advertising touts this place as being ultra luxurious, which it definitely is not. In Orange County, there actually ARE luxurious movie theatres (Cinepolis). And it is located on the top floor of a virtually vacant shopping center, which is a little creepy.\\n\\nThere is underground parking -- take your parking ticket for validation. Nice facility, kept very clean -- but it is hard to get enthusiastic about a shopping venue that has more vacant storefronts than stores.\\n\\nI hadn&acute;t been to the Anaheim garden walk in several years, but I had out of town guests and decided to take them to Disneyland and then stop at the movie theatre. The theatre was busy, the rest of the center was like a ghost town.\\n\\nFrom what I remember from a few years ago, the center was never all that busy, however, at least it was somewhat populated. I stopped in to one of the stores and asked the clerk what had happened to all the other stores -- he said that the center is now under new management and would be repopulating soon. Hope so -- it is a nice facility! What a great place to visit. It is obviously more special for young kids that teenagers but we enjoyed it all the same Disneyland is great and so is California Adventure Park. However, it doesnt have the big rides that our teens loved in Knotts Berry Farm',\n",
              " 'Every Bangkok visit should include the Grand palace and so did ours. Ignore all the touts trying to sell you whatever tours or I do not know what....proceed to the main entrance, buy tickets and in you go. Very impressive buildings and very impressive architecture. Do follow the rules - take off your shoes and caps when required and do NOT take photos when you see signs about it. Those places are sacred to Thai people and we are guests in their country. I saw someone take a photo and he was immediately approached by a guard and he had to delete it. If you want to show something to friends google for better pics, most tourists do not know how to take nice photos indoors anyway....it always surprises me on how people still do not understand that you should NOT use flash if you want to have usable photo. Taking a boat across the river from Wat Pho is only 3THB and you can enjoy the views on Wat Arun on the way. It is really impressive to see it and seeing the tourists conquering the steep steps - fun :) Some really have problems going down again, but trust me, it is really worth it for the views alone. You do not need a lot of time and probably is best to reserve this temple for the late afternoon to enjoy the setting sun (at leafs in the winter time). A must do in Bangkok, it is very impressive to see the huge buddha statue and for the price of entrance you also get a free bottle of water - nice touch!\\n\\nToilets were SPOTLESS AND WOW, all the respect to maintenance staff, we were really surprised!\\n\\nMassage is available in the Temple premises and I certainly do recommend it! Plan your visit to the temple somewhere in the middle of the day and treat yourself a nice foot massage to give you new powers for the day to conquer more of Bangkok! We went to the Chatuchak market directly from hotel with Sky train (only 42tbh per person) on sunday. I was a bit scarred but arriving there at approx. 13:00 was quite OK. It was a bit cloudy, so sun was not shining directly on our heads and that helped too. Yes there are a lot of people there, but you can always go in a row/lane that is not crowded and avoid the worst crowds.\\n\\nA lot of stalls also have fans or even aircon, so you can strategically plan your purchases with nice free cooling :)\\n\\nFood & drinks available all over and exchange office at all entrances! Bottled water was only 10thb so no worries there. Coconut ice cream, fried chicken, coconut water, shrimps...everything delicious!\\n\\nThere is HUGE amour of stuff available and what is really great is that nobody will bother you with: \"Please come see, Please buy blablabla\". Sellers keep to themselves and will offer help if you need it.\\n\\nMost purchases we made were really not for 50% off the prices, but we noticed that stalls which have written prices have them set low in the start already....or I am just a very bad negotiator :)\\n\\nBe sure to come here, there is plenty for anyone! Have been frequenting only this spa when I stay on soi 8. Located right at the start of soi 8 and just a stone throw from Nana BTS, this spa is the cleaner, better decorated and nicer ambience among the lot. Prices are somewhat similar to many of those street side spas.\\n\\nThis is a family spa and no dirty business is conducted. I find the overall service to be friendly unlike how some reviewers have indicated otherwise. Thais are generally friendly and soft spoken unless you irked them.\\n\\nIts located beside the street so the occasional traffic noise can be heard. I think this adds to the authencity of a thai city massge. If you want a peaceful top notch massage, then please pay for one otherwise expect monkeys for peanuts. I&acute;m not saying to avoid this spa as I have always enjoyed, but there are various masseurs with varying skills.... so its a game of luck at times. BTS service is very good and efficient. Buying tickets is also easy since there are counters which provide change which can then be fed in machines for tickets. Hasslefree travel in crowded Bangkok! Yes, the music is canned and the singing is all lip-sync. But the production, especially the costume,s are beautiful, and it is fast-paced and great fun for an hour or so. With the right attitude, it is really enjoyable. If you want a Las Vegas or Broadway experience, stay home. The cabaret style show room at the Asiatique is very comfortable and everything is well-organized. As a first-time experience for me, it was good fun. Blue Elephant does have the reputation of being THE Cooking School for Thai Cuisine (at least for foreigners/ expats/ travellers) and the house it&acute;s located in is beautiful...but when it came to taking a class, not only was it with a group of +10 but I felt our instructors were a bit too robotic: demo-taste-kitchen-demo-taste-kitchen and so on...it felt VERY RUSHED...I&acute;ve visited other cooking schools in Bangkok which offered a very different experience in a positive way (some for half the price, at least one that charged the same)..\\n\\non the plus side, I found the visit to the market very useful, although I did go back on my own after since again, the tour with our group didn&acute;t last more than 15 minutes...food presentation, tableware, decor, all the orchids!, the house itself was much appreciated..\\n\\ncould give them another try...maybe a different story if done with smaller groups (if they do small groups..) Been coming here for the past 6 years...the premises are still well maintained, good packages on their menu list, staff change constantly so I&acute;m really not recognized as a regular but still get very good service from everyone each time we go back...other spas have stepped their game up and there are much more newer ones now where you do get pampered and get treated like royalty...it will also reflect on your bill but still worth visiting one if you have the time or don&acute;t mind spending more...you come to Leyana for a good treatment at a very decent rate without it having to be a \"special occasion\"...I prefer going in the evening when it&acute;s much more quiet and going directly to bed afterwards...still plan to go back on future trips to Bangkok.. Probably one of the priciest in Bangkok for a half-day course but expected when you&acute;re booking at the Mandarin Oriental so at least you already know the premises will be top-notch and that the class was going to be personalized...an easy advantage since they only do small groups (4 in my class)...most memorable part of the day would have to be Chef Narain Kiattiyotcharoen who not only showed passion in what he does but also genuine interest in each one of us, making sure we actually did learn a thing or 2, unlike other cooking classes where our instructors seemed jaded (who wouldn&acute;t after giving the same class over and over again)...after class, he still took the time to answer my many questions and gave me a list of places to go buy utensils, ingredients, cookbooks, etc....????????? !!! We travelled from Central Pier to Stop 8 and then transferred across the river to get to Wat Arun temple. We caught the &acute;locals&acute; boat which cost 20 baht each as opposed to the Tourist Ferry which cost 150 baht each. Just make sure you get in the line that says &acute;No Tickets&acute; and catch a boat with a green, orange or no flag. We caught the Airport Rail Link (city line) from Phaya Thai to Suvarnambhurri airport. Total cost per person was 45 baht per person for a 45 minute ride in a clean, safe and airconditioned train. Would definitely recommend this as a way to and from the airport. When we first arrived we paid over $100 AUD for airport travel and on the way back to the airport we paid just over $4.50 AUD for the 3 of us! Whilst in Bangkok we visited all the major temples. Wat Arun is definitely a must see. Make sure you go early to beat the crowds. following our visit to the Grand Palace we walked to the Wat Pho. What an amazing Buddha. She&acute;s so huge. There are signs there warning everyone of the pickpocket gangs that operate here.\\nAnother definite must see attraction whilst in Bangkok. We took the advise of fellow TA and arrived early to beat the rush. We had to buy a few sarongs before we entered the Grand Palace. Its quite amazing the temples, statues and the attention to detail that has gone into the palace. Definitely a must see attraction.',\n",
              " 'The gardens are very pleasant, but nothing out of the ordinary. They are not the original, but fairly modern. If you&acute;re pressed for time after visiting The Alhambra (a &acute;must see&acute;), then don&acute;t be too concerned about missing out on Generalife. More than a club, the Camp Nou museum and stadium tour contextualises the historical, cultural, social and sporting significance of FC Barcelona to the city and the Catalan people.\\n\\nIt is very well put together and worth including in a visit to Barcelona, whether a football fan or not.\\n\\nAs an aside, the prominence of Qatar Airways sponsorship is incredible. This took my breath away. I didn&acute;t expect to like it from the outside pictures I had seen so many times, but it is just so beautiful and breathtaking inside. Don&acute;t miss it for anything. It is truly special.\\n\\nWhatever you do, purchase the tickets and the audio guide online beforehand. It saves considerable time queueing, and also get there early. I took my 85 year old father to Barcelona recently and we hired a Scooter Rascal 388 from Cosmo Scooters. It was excellent! It was delivered to his hotel - he was given a quick lesson on how to use it and an emergency contact number. At the end of the stay we just left the keys at the hotel reception. Would highly recommend - it made visiting Barcelona possible! This was the third place I visited with my 85 year old father. We were so well looked after. The staff provided a wheelchair and took my father in the lift to every floor. An excellent visit. Thank you very much Took my 85 year old father who has trouble walking. The staff provided a wheelchair and help him to get upstairs in the lift. Excellent service and he was thrilled to see Gaudi&acute;s work The Mies van der Rohe Pavilion is an outstanding example of the architect&acute;s work and homage to his minimalist style. This is in stark contrast to all other architectural landmarks in Barcelona which are more in line with Gaudi&acute;s work. The spaces have beed well considered and the materials used compliment the simple spaces.\\nA must if you are interested in Architecture. Great to walk around the Olympic Park.\\nFree entry, go at your own pace.\\nNice to sit down an take it all in.\\nThe stadium is very cool, Olympic flame n all.\\nWorth a visit, can hop off and back on the city guides, tour bus, Julia tours, well good tour. Wow is all i can say !\\nNever seen so many trophies !\\nIt is some sight to see, the size of the place is bosh !\\nwalk around at our own pace, nice walk up to the commentators box, some view of the whole place.\\nGreat museum all of Messi&acute;s golden boots there !\\nDefo one for a footie fan Ive never seen so many water fountains in the one palce before !\\nVery cool when they are all going off in sync. I stayed in the Gotic quarter,\\ngreat walking around the old lanes, all the buildings, churches, great vibe about the place ! I didnt book tickets before i went. 10am very little que, ВЈ15 entry, pay another ВЈ4.50 if you want to go up to the towers.\\nAmazing Cathedral, walk around at ur leisure.\\nPain n my neck from looking up !\\nIs a must see in barca.\\nMake sure to go downstairs to the basement, great pics and history of the place.\\nHighly recommend. Fabulous, even for those who are not Christian or religious, a wonderful building, well worth a visit. Take a trip up the towers for fabulous views out over Barcelona Although we didn&acute;t see the inside or have enough time to do it. We took pictures outside and the house is fascinating! We will definitely come back and see during another visit. Would recommend you purchase tickets on line to beat the lines. Access is free, the displays are interesting but the crowds are oppressive. Get their early and spend a couple of hours enjoying the exhibits. Did not plan on visiting the Caso Batllo but the queue for La Pedrera was so long we wandered down and walked straight in here. Enjoyed looking round but the audio guide was very long winded and repetitive . Enjoyed our trip to Park Guell on a beautiful sunny day. We took a picnic and enjoyed eating that in the lovely surroundings - although there was a lot less grass around as we thought (we obviously hadn&acute;t done our research) and so were surprised to find it was mostly garden/tree areas. It was nice to stroll around and admire the Gaudi architecture - be warned it&acute;s a popular place! Really enjoyed visiting the Sagrada Familia, so different from a normal church - really interesting and amazing to see. It&acute;s worth getting tickets online - the queues were very long to get in but with online tickets we walked straight in. A lovely park to go for a stroll, take a picnic or just enjoy the interesting design and listen to some of the various musicians - some more talented than others... Interesting building to see and the progression of work. Long queue to go inside so decided to view internal architecture etc online and spend our time doing something more interesting. I attended an event at Magic Fountain - had it not been for the event I would not have gone to Magic Fountain while in Barcelona. It is a beautiful place. I was initially reluctant to do this tour, but am I glad my wife persuaded me. Peter was an ideal guide, showing us numerous points of interest, making some informed recommendations regarding restaurants (which we did take up) and, most of all, giving us a most enjoyable and informative tour.\\nThe bike and side-car were comfortable and suitable for all ages. We would recommend this tour to anyone who wants something a little different. My wife and I love history, but our knowledge of the Spanish Civil War was patchy at best. After spending time with Nick on this tour we have learnt so much and even developed an interest in this period specifically and want to discover more.\\nNick&acute;s obvious passion is contagious and he draws the whole group into his world. We had a very mixed group of many different nationalities which only served to enrich the experience.\\nAn easy walk with fascinating points of interest along the way and a nice bar to finish the tour and continue the ongoing discussions. My wife and I decided to do this trip on our first night in the city. And boy, are we pleased that we did. Edouard was informative, attentive, charming and a perfect host. The 3 restaurants that we visited were different, but of a high quality in providing a good introduction to Barcelona cuisine.\\nA few hours well spent and an excellent tour all round.',\n",
              " 'A hike that will leave you tired but smiling. We loved the remote trails, the sound of sheep bells and the stunning scenery. A must-do for anyone who is up to it and a vastly superior experience to the tourist-clogged Hanseatic Wharf area.\\n\\nA word to the wise though... the trail book from the tourist office is a bit out of date and some of the trail markers are different. It&acute;s hard to get truly lost but not always easy to follow the trials as described. Although there is much to be appreciated in and around Bergen but the Wharf area feels like a machine to harvest money from hapless tourists. Couple that with the vast volume of tourists and you have a great income for the local economy and an unrealistic experience for the visitors. Venture a few blocks of the well-beaten path and you&acute;ll find a much richer Bergen experience. I read suggestions online from Bergen residents regarding hiking the peaks around the city. These hikes are definitely some of the highlights of a visit to Norway&acute;s second largest city.\\n\\nMost tourists flock to the funicular, ride it to the top, take their photos from the elevated viewpoint and ride back down. This is the best way to completely miss the beauty of the region. Even a short hike will quickly reveal lakes, water falls, and gorgeous vistas which make the initial view pale in comparison. The mossy forests look like something right out of Middle Earth and should not be missed. It&acute;s easy to see where the popular local troll legends come from as the mountainous woodland certainly does feel magical.\\n\\nTrail maps are available at the tourist office and hikes range from quite easy to exhaustingly difficult.\\n\\nThe easy hikes will take you to lakes and and gentle spots to relax and take in the scenery and get a feel for this magical area and still allow you to make it back to the cafe for lunch.\\n\\nThe moderate and hard hikes ranging from 4-8 hours will take you up and away from the crowds. You&acute;ll venture above the tree line, see World War Two batteries, cross bridges and dams, visit numerous ancient ruins and see magnificent views about which only tiniest fraction of the funicular riders even know.\\n\\nThe funicular and the view from Mount Floyen are a \"don&acute;t miss\" but don&acute;t stop there... the train ride and the observation platform are only the doorway to the majesty of the mountains surrounding Bergen. Picturesque area in the capital with wood buildings serving as government offices. Deserves a stroll round great photo opportunities. Great place to wander round, take photos. Restaurants selling fish obviously with outside seating cooked to order. Lovely place for a meal, glass of wine and people watching. Located by the fish harbour. Make this your first port of call in Bergen its open late. Large selection of tour and attraction brochures in many languages. You can book toours here. Great advice. They also sell stamps. I took a half day high speed tour. Good facilities on the boat. There was an English speaking commentary. The boat nosed into a waterfall and a crew member collected a bucket of water for the guests to taste. Excellent value for money. Epic view, nice hiking area, and a cozy cafe/restaurant at the top. If you plan to visit in the morning, be prepared for a wait. We passed by at 9:00 a.m. and found the queue out the door and down to the next street. At noon it was not much better. After dinner we walked right in and were at the top in minutes. If you want to stretch your legs, purchase a one-way ticket and set aside 40 minutes to walk down on easy paths.',\n",
              " 'The box is only a temporary exhibit while construction takes place next door at the new humboldt plaza. The box gives an insight to what the new buildings will look like and contains sample exhibits which will be in the new museum. Entrance is free, and the sample exhibits are really very good. Worth a stop by if you are near museum island. A large collection, presented in a stunning building with great architecture. It is worth visiting the neues museum just to see the building! The key exhibits are Nefertiti and the Gold Hat, both are well presented and you can get right up close to the artefacts.\\nQueuing to get tickets for entrance is inconvenient, and there is nothing to interact with in the museum, it is all glass cases of artefacts, hence me giving it just 3*. We found the information very interesting as we walked along the\\nBerlin wall remnants and learned all about its history. It is great how the Berliners have presented the history in such an open and honest appraisal. We were enthralled by the Holocaust Memorial. It was so well presented and really gave you an insight into what the jews experienced. It is very touching and to listen to some of the things that people went through on a personal basis, it was very sobering. It was a really nice experience to see the Berlin graffiti culture. Although I still think that these guys are ruining other people&acute;s property it was nice to see some really cool stuff and to understand what they do and why they do it.\\n\\nThe tour is four to five hours and you need public transportation tickets to participate and to get back to your hotel.\\n\\nAt the end they let you to make your own \"piece of art\". It was fun! A very interesting exhibit about those sad times. It is very well put together (as far as I can tell) but this should be far more interactive. They use big billboards full of text and photos. That is needed, and in place. I was missing the the other types of communication. Anyhow I think they made a very good job. We were here in July 2014. We went for a tour with a guide who was very nice and very knowledgeable. The tour was wonderful. The building itself is only nice, but nothing really special. If you are in Berlin go and see it ( be careful, you need to have a reservation well in advance due to security reasons) but do not expect anything earthshaking. We went on a two hours tour. The tour was great. This is a very effective way to see the most important thing in Berlin in a short time. The tour guide was knowledgeable, he had spoken a very good English and it was huge fun.\\n\\nIt is the best way to get a first look at Berlin, than you can decide what you want to explore more. The gardens were an easy walk, or a very short bus ride from our hotel - the Steglitz International.\\n\\nYou may visit on your own, or take a guided tour. The garden is well laid out, and the various trees and plants are well marked. Walked in the museum, and almost immediately saw the 6th century BC Babylonian Ishtar Gate. What an incredible sight, with the glazed blue tiles ! I just stood there and stared, in amazement .That an object of such great beauty and craftmanship has survived to our time is amazing. A must see.\\n\\nAlthough some of the sights, such as the Pergamon altar were cordoned off for restauration, there was more than enough to see in the 2 hours that I had at this museum. I hope that I can soon return. This is not actually the original or genuine Checkpoint Charlie. It is a mock up of what the checkpoint looked looked like in the 1950s. It is in the middle of a fairly busy street, so you have to dodge between vehicles to get to it. It is also not even in the position of the actualy check point, which as 150m along the road.\\n\\nIt is a shame that this iconic piece of history is presented so badly.',\n",
              " 'We went this past weekend with a friend visiting from out of town because it seemed like something fun and different to do (and we had a LivingSocial coupon). It&acute;s pretty much exactly what it sounds like - everything is made of ice and it&acute;s 21 degrees at all times. We happened to go on a night when it was 18 degrees outside, which was kind of hilarious. It&acute;s very cold inside (duh), but really fun for a short time (45 minutes, tops) and makes for some great photo opportunities with the big parkas they provide and the cups made of ice. Admission - without a coupon - is pretty steep and at $11/drink, it could make for an expensive night, but I&acute;d definitely recommend you try it out - once. There many historical and contemporary pieces. I was not expecting a collection that rich.\\nA real must see spot in Boston. I was expecting more, probably something along that of a haunted house experience with horror surprise scares and etc, but this was more of an informative historical tour of Boston&acute;s tradition.\\n\\nThe dressed up actors added to the drama and story telling for without them, it would be similar to an ordinary day tour.\\n\\nI would recommend this to American tourists or someone keen into American history. As a tourist from other country, it was hard to really grasp the importance of the characters told.\\n\\nHowever, walking into a graveyard steeped in age in the middle of the night with no proper lighting is a new fun experience. Try to enjoy a summer lazy Friday evening with live music performances, wine and oyster tastings and some cool exhibition. Ensure to show up after 4 or 5pm so will have chance to enjoy natural daylight and cool evening sunset Think of a time capsule super curated art collection ranging from early romanic to gothic and high renaissance period. The museum has a lively cafe and the settings are amazing. ICA is located in a uber-cool contemporary frosted glass cube which contrasts a lot with the red brick turn of the century neo-gothical Bostonian townhouses. The summer event called First Fridays are held in the outdoor area where locals sip sangrias, local beers and taste oysters and pickles listening to a local bluegrass band. The Visitors is the current exhibition and adds a lot of mellow and cool ambiance to this museum visit. Totally recommended !!!! This is a great park to take a break in while in Boston. The scenery is beautiful and the people watching is always enjoyable. Also in the garden are the famous swan boat rides ($3.00/person) which are great for a family with children and the statue of Mrs. Mallard and her children from the children&acute;s book \"Make Way for Ducklings\". There is a suggested $3 donation and then another $1 for a self-guided tour brochure. We enjoyed our time there. We arrived when they opened which allowed us to enjoy the space without the crowds that would descend later in the day. It is an active church. Not on this trip but on a prior one we attended a service there which was special. We paid $3 each to enter and it was a nice enough time and the thing to do when in Boston if you&acute;ve never done it before. I remember being there years ago when the tour was fully guided and this time it was self-guided with a staff person available to answer questions. I learned so much more with the guided tour and I wish it was still happening. The house is small and dark and a person should expect to spend about 20 - 30 min. there. we just happened upon the frog pond in Boston Common. Nothing special necessarily about the pond but instead we fell in love with the life sized bronze frog statues at the end. I believe their names were \"Tommy\" and \"Angela\". It was a great whimsical discovery. There were other bronze frogs in the play land/splash pad that we didn&acute;t go in to see but noticed thru the fence. We weren&acute;t on a tour and had no agenda in mind except to enjoy the character of Beacon Hill. There was much to enjoy as we strolled along. Make the time a visit to Beacon Hill. We loved seeing a game at Fenway and enjoyed the experience of being in an older but extremely well maintained park. We were in Section 33 (a family section, no alcohol permitted), row 3. We didn&acute;t know how the view would be but found we really enjoyed being in the corner next to the Green Monster and the left field foul line. We were very grateful to have been given the tip of getting off at the Kenmore T station instead of the Fenway T station as we would have done. I would encourage people to walk the Freedom Trail so a person would see the historical highlights of the city. However, I would also encourage people to take a few side streets to and really get into the city and away from the throngs of tourists on the \"trail\". With an attraction this popular there is always the chance it won&acute;t live up to all the hype. We were so pleased with the experience and tour from Boston Duck Tours and would highly recommend it to anyone visiting the area. Our guide, MacIn Quack, was wonderful. Entertaining but by no means over the top which we espeically appreciated, we learned a LOT!! An opportunity arose for volunteers to \"drive\" the duck while on the Charles River and I enjoyed my time at the helm, of course with a little assistance from the \"conDUCKtor\".\\n\\nWe went on the 9am tour from the Prudential Center and I would encourage anyone to consider this timing because the duck wasn&acute;t completely full and allowed for a more pleasant experience instead of being squeezed in 2 to a seat which we saw other tours throughout the day doing. I booked a 3 hour tour for myself, my sister and her 2 youngest (ages 13 and 11) while we were in Boston for the 4th. We weren&acute;t going to have a lot of time in Boston and I wanted to something other than the standard hop on/off tour for us to see the city. Boston Gliders was the PERFECT thing. We had a fantastic time gliding through the city with Captain Jimbo. We hit most of the highlights around downtown. The harbor, Back Bay, Boston Commons, Fenway Park, Financial District, Chinatown, Theater District, etc. He even took requests (Copley Square).\\nI was a bit nervous about riding the Segway, but it was incredibly easy. Two minutes of training and I was ready to go and after about an hour I was swerving comfortably through the streets of Boston as if I&acute;d been gliding for years. Who knew gliding could be so easy?\\nThe only suggestion I have is that Boston Seggliders upgrade their headphone/speaker system as they seem a bit chintzy. But really, if there is a good headphone/speaker system out there, I&acute;ve not used it on ANY tour I&acute;ve been on (not in Disneyland, not in Italy, and not in Boston).',\n",
              " 'We were collected from our hotel and taken to Bridgetown to join the Taimi catamaran which took us along the west coast, stopping off to snorkell and then to to another beach where we swam with turtles. The bar was open right from the very start with a very wide selection of premium drinks. We were served a buffet lunch which was plentiful and varied. Altogether, a very good day out. We dived with Hightide Water Sports and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The Stav is slowly collapsing and has become more interesting than when we dived it 2 years ago. Because we had a one-on-one dive we got to see much more than with a larger group previously. We can&acute;t fault Hightide! We first went to the centre two years ago as part of an organised tour of Barbados. This time, we decided to try and arrange the visit ourselves, and the experience was well worth the effort. Having checked on the tour times, we caught the local yellow reggae bus (an amazing experience in itself) to the main bus station in Bridgetown (2 Barbados$ for any length of a single trip) At the bus station, we changed to a number 4 mini bus (again 2$ Barbados) We asked to be put of at the visitor centre and only had to walk a matter of 100 meters or so.\\nThe tour of the centre is fantastic and costs $20 Barbados (ВЈ6+). You get to see a film of the process of making the rum, a guided tour of the antiquities at the centre, a look at the bottling plant and best of all, a tasting session where several of the strengths are tasted and the process and time of distilling is described. After the tour, you can visit their gift shop and buy Mount Gay rum at a very reasonable cost, go to their own bar and taste more rum (at a small charge) There is also a cafe/terrace where you can order food.\\nWe thought retracing our steps to Bridgetown would be difficult, so we asked the gateman to order a taxi for us, to get us back to the hotel. All in all, a fastastic morning out. We dived with High Tide Water Sports from their catamaran dive boat. They picked us up from our hotel at Alomd Beach Village and dropped us back after the dives. Very professional set up and Sim the guide and Victor the boat captain were very helpful and informative. This was organised as part of a day trip around the island organised by Almond Beach Village. We were greeted with a taste of Mount Gay and then shown around the site. Very informative and we were given samples of their various aged rums with explanations about the taste differences etc. altogether a very enjoyable experience. We&acute;ll go again! As a party of 6 people in their 50&acute;s we had the most fantastic trip with Cool Runnings in March this year. I have done many catamaran trips and none with a more attentive group of people, they made sure that every person on the trip had a good experience, from making sure that youngsters had fun to ensuring that older people who could not swim were also able to swim with the turtles, safely accompanied by one of the crew with floats to hold on to. The food was good and the rum punch was great, I&acute;m not the kind to let my hair down but we were all up dancing on the front of the boat on the way home! I could not visit Barbados again without repeating this trip. Just back from our 17th holiday in Barbados and while we have been on large &acute;party cats&acute; and chartered smaller cats in the past, Silver Moon was by far the best sailing experience that we have had to date.\\n\\nI booked 7 of the 12 spaces available for the 5 hour swim/lunch cruise which was great value. We all swam with and stroked turtles and snorkelled over two shipwrecks. One of the crew is in the water with you as a guide / to feed the turtles and to keep everyone safe. There were a couple of non swimmers on the boat which was not a problem given the amount of swimming aids available for them.\\n\\nThere are separate bathrooms on board for men and women which you do not get on smaller cats, and plenty of room in them to change into and out of swim wear.\\n\\nLunch was taken sat at the dining tables to the rear of the cat and was of great quality (fish, chicken, macaroni pie, coleslaw, salad etc) and drinks were free flowing from the moment you are on board. The Banana Bread and Pina Colada for the cruise back was not compulsory but we all had one!\\n\\nIt was a great 5 hours, the crew were fantastic, very attentive and clearly love the boat (a Leopard 47 worth a cool US$2m) - perhaps one day if I work harder....\\n\\nThe price is great value if you consider the entire package and it includes transfers to and from the boat moored in Bridgetown harbour.\\n\\nThanks for a top day. If you are a cricket fan Kensington Oval is definitely worth a visit. The stands are pretty old but this is one international ground that allows you to walk out on the field. The tour guide was informative and Joel Garner was around saying good bye to the young Barbados team who were heading on a tour.',\n",
              " 'Enjoyed seeing the buildings from the river, unfortunately not enough seats on the boat so had to stand. Part of deal on the Big Bus Tour This bridge is more beautiful at night, where lights add to its whiteness. it&acute;s the one next to Chain bridge. It&acute;s a lovely square, where one can enjoy walking around, having a meal, watch performances or just have an ice cream. The church was lovely to capture pics of it. Its surroundings were beautiful. Great view & performances. We enjoyed the area with ice cream :) It has a beautiful architecture from the outside. It was my first time to see a synagogue. It was beautiful. Arriving the square by metro, we started by the city park and walked through it to the Heroes&acute; square. It is a beautiful one surrounded by beautiful buildings. We enjoyed it. One can spend some time seeing the those buildings and taking pics of the statues in the middle of the square. We took pics of that lovely building without stopping. It just attracts the camera from every angle possible. It is a remarkable building. If you have any interest in WW2 or the Cold War, you&acute;ll want to visit this museum. If you&acute;re not interested, the mix of art installations and bite-size history might awaken an interest.\\n\\nA couple of the art installations could do with some explanation. I had to look up details of the soap labyrinth afterwards online in some student dissertation\\n\\nI was not sure about the politics at times. How did the Communists leave power? The museum doesn&acute;t mention that they held multi-party elections. The leadership even let picnickers rip a hole in the Iron Curtain so East German refugees could vote with their feet. The Commies of the 80s had evolved in Hungary from the vicious Stalinists of the 40s and 50s. The museum specialises in black and white - a bit of grey would add to the depth and perspective.\\n\\nMinor reservations aside, I do highly recommend the museum. The tour of the underground hospital and nuclear bunker was fascinating as well as offering an insight into Hungary during the second world war and the Cold War. The guide spoke excellent English. (Unfortunately the group was a little large with some ill-mannered individuals who chatted amongst themselves but the guide could be heard almost all of the time.) There is really nothing but the view. Other attractions close by but they have their own review. For some part of the bastion you have to pay entrance. DO NOT BUY TICKETS there is nothing different and the entrance price is crazy. If you enjoy wine it&acute;s well worth a visit here in the cellars of the Hilton Hotel on Castle Hill, Buda.\\n\\nMine Host speaks English like a machine gun, but ask him to slow down and he can be understood.\\n\\nTry three different excellent Tokaijs for around $14 Had a fantastic time here, especially in the outdoor pools when it was freezing cold! We had no idea there were so many pools and saunas inside either and had great fun exploring even if most of the time we had no idea what was going on! It was a cold day and we were walking past with our nearly 3 year old saw this and thought we would go in. We were so glad we did as it was great fun and really interesting.\\nFelt like we had a tour of Budapest without getting cold and wet!\\nOur daughter loved all the buttons that she could press.\\nCafe not great but was fine for a drink and snack. I can agree with all the positive reviews in this topic. Pure relaxation, excellent service, must masage I&acute;ve ever had! Abolutely recommended!',\n",
              " 'First thing, this visiter center was not easy to locate the day we arrived. Construction on the street, a cement truck parked to block the entrance - found it though, parked in the building titled \"BLOCK\" and the elevator let us off on the first level, right in the visiter center, which is also the hub for the best thing there: two FREE electric buses, one taking tourists to the North Shore of Chattanooga, across the Tennessee River, the other takes one down a main street fir shopping and to Chattanooga Choo Choo. All buses run circular routes so feel free to get on, get off wherever you like for sight-seeing and shopping. We took the North Shore bus across the river then walked back across the historic Walnut Street bridge - what a nice sight that was. Then we took the Choo Choo route, and stopped off once to shop the Moon Pie General Store. A fun day. The Walnut Street Bridge walk has to be the epitome of pleasure walks, spanning the Tennessee River, and joining downtown&acute;s Tennessee Riverwalk with Coolidge Park on the far side of the river. They say you cannot tour the Moon Pie Factory - Chattanooga Bakery - so our best bet was a visit to the Moon Pie General Store on Broad Street, We found FREE parking place, walked into the store and found a very congenial group of young folks working in the store - friendly, eager to aid their customers . . . it was a nice experience.\\n\\nAND, I bought a MOON PIE tee shirt and a dozen Moon Pies. Wished later that I had tried the other flavors - think there was strawberry and orange - I&acute;ve never seen them at home. A former train station that is now a hotel/conference center/amusement area. We spent about 2 hours just walking around and looking at the old Railroad cars, many of which are now hotel rooms. We were able to take a peek at one and although the idea of staying in one of these rooms seems exciting, that&acute;s where it ends (at least to us).\\nRooms/railroad cars seemed to be a bit musty. Small accommodations and a bathroom that really need an upgrade. Interiors were dark, which made the room appear even smaller.\\nSprinkled throughout the complex are restaurants, gift shops, a museum, the lobby of the rail-station and unforgettable rose gardens.\\nWe did have a lot of fun walking around, there was a convention of retired Veterns while we were there and it gave us the opportunity to thank them for their service and have them recall a time when &acute;riding the rails&acute; was how you got from point A to point B.\\nThe Rose Gardens are not to be missed!! Each year, a new variety of a rose is featured. I think you can take an old time Trolley ride as well!! Kids will have a great time.\\nEither the lobby area gets a lot of traffic or the carpets have not been tended to, but some parts are in need of help.\\nWalking around and peeking in is free, but there are some things, such as the museum and train rides that I imagine would have a fee attached. There was no game the week we were there but we did get to visit the Team Store. The history of the park is heartwarming. Rode our bikes here and enjoyed a great lunch. Downtown seems to be hilly so you can get tired out quickly. took our bikes as far as we could on the Riverwalk till we decided, that going down the hill meant you had to come back up it too! We have been to the Tennessee Aquarium on a number of occasions, and each visit is worth it. The admission price is a bit high, but you can definitely spend half a day or more checking out the exhibits, seeing an IMAX film, or taking the River Tour.\\n\\nThe aquarium focuses on freshwater fish, especially Tennessee native species. Falls were good and the walk through the caverns was interesting. Had to queue to get in even though we had already got our tickets.\\nUnfortunately it felt a little too restricted and regimented following the path and then having to get out through the gift shop. I would still recommend a visit though.',\n",
              " 'We spent the morning browsing the sites. At museums I tend to get overwhelmed by all the beautiful things so I always like to have some specific items to view. The museum guide gives a list and location of the top 10 items. I&acute;m a picasso fan so looked at the recommendations and then spent extra time looking at the picassos. Time well spent Good fun and views were downright fabulous especially as this building being closer to the lake showed us more all around --- Well organised and laid out with various geographic locations ---lots of photographic opportunities ---great collection of aquatic fauna--penguins to sharks to nemo -- U 505 exhibition was so heart rending -- loved the way the exhibits had been arranged ---science sections with on going experiments were lovely ---sad we didnt give it a full day but only 2 hours --needs a full day to enjoy for sure--located a bit far off Smooth entry with the go Chicago Card and liked the views ---depending on the weather one could get a clear or obstructed view ---good experience overall --should try to get the sunset Finally got to go between Shedd Aquarium and Navy Pier. What a great ride and pleasure to see the Chicago skyline on a beautiful fall day. Only wish the ride was longer. Well worth it and not to be missed if you have children. They will love it! Couldn&acute;t leave Chicago without going on the Skydeck. Went on a Saturday and knew there would be long lines, however, the way it was handled bordered on ridiculous. Better to come to this attraction on an off day during the week. There was a line outside the building, then an elevator to the basement. We had a Chicago CityPass which allowed us to skip the ticket line, then in another line to have our bags checked like at an airport. Somehow we never saw where we should have seen the movie and didn&acute;t see it. Then another line to go in the elevator to the viewing area. Very cool elevator ride (around 50 seconds to go the 103rd floor). Totally packed up in the viewing area and very hard to see out. We did get a professional picture on the Ledge which was well worth the whole frustrating experience. Then into another line to go down to the basement, channeled through their gift shop and in another line to get up to the first floor. Needless to say we won&acute;t be going back to this attraction, even with guests. Not worth the cost. Visited the Shedd multiple times. Each time hoping it will improve, however seems to be getting worse. Came early enough to wait in line for it to open this past Saturday. Purchased the Chicago CityPass tickets for multiple attractions. The Oceanarium Show with Beluga&acute;s and Dolphins was mediocre, while not showing much. We&acute;ve seen more at the Dolphin Show at Brookfield Zoo. Plus it was so crowded at the 10:30 a.m. showing--felt the staff didn&acute;t care and shoved too many people in the stands. My daughter was kicked in the head by a teenager trying to leave the show early. We thought the 4-D Ice Age movie would be better. Huge disappointment. The movie was 15 minutes tops. Expected it to be at least 30 minutes. We felt we were seriously taken advantage of with what we paid for these attractions. Won&acute;t be going to the Shedd any time in future if we can help it. We went to TSNY (Chicago) because we saw a Groupon for a great deal. We were so nervous but the instructors were fantastic and it ended up being a good experience. My friend took to \"flying\" better than I did but I think her extra height actually helped. Once on the platform the trapeze bar was quite a distance away and being short, I was fully extended and then some. I&acute;m a person who gets motion sick rather quickly so took Dramamine before the class which worked quite well but I obviously didn&acute;t time it right as it wore off before the end of class. We were in a class with only a few others so got extra turns which we thought was great. Someone is there taking photos which can be bought after wards for a very reasonable price, I would suggest buying them. you cannot take anything like what they can with their vantage points. it was a good experience and I&acute;m glad I did it (checked off the bucket list) but I don&acute;t feel a need to do it again. We visited twice, once in the day and once by night. This is on the 95th floor of the Hancock building near to the Water Tower. Don&acute;t confuse The Signature Lounge with the Signature Room which is the restaurant one floor below. If in Chicago the Signature Lounge is a must do. I would go here in preference to the &acute;skywalk&acute; tower as the views are similar and there is no entrance fee, you only need to buy a drink if you want to sit and enjoy the stunning views. Drinks are reasonably priced and it is worth waiting to get a window table but you can walk around the whole bar to see the different perspectives of Chicago.\\nRemember you need photo ID to get into the lifts that rocket you to the top and it is wise choosing your time carefully. We initially went on a Sunday evening, the night of the Chicago Marathon and waits were horrendous so we passed and returned a different day. On both occasions we revisited there were no queues other than a short wait at the top for a window table.\\nService is not particularly friendly or efficient but you don&acute;t go to be pampered, just to experience the amazing views overlooking the skyscrapers nestling below you.\\nWell recommended as a must do activity in Chicago! My wife would disagree with me and give this 5 stars as she is into Blues more than me. We arrived about 9pm on a Wednesday night and the Blues was pumping and the bar/club was pleasantly full. During the 2 hours we were there, there was a steady stream of people coming and going so fortunately, everyone could get a seat in this small and atmospheric venue. There is a 10 dollars a head entrance fee which is very good value and drinks are reasonably priced. Wine was 9 dollars a glass and Gin and Tonic only 6 dollars - a snip. The doorman was a character in himself!\\nThe punters seemed to mainly be tourists and you can order at the bar or from the one server, who was very pleasant and efficient.\\nThe Blues singers the night we were there were excellent and accomplished Blues musicians. They created a really good vibe and everyone was enjoying themselves.\\nIf in Chicago, this is well worth putting on your list and is easily walkable, being only 6 blocks off Michigan. Glad we visited as Blue Chicago added to our Chicago experience. We took out the 3 days pass with Big Bus and it was very good vale for money. we did the full circuit twice and ten used it to get to Millennium Park and Navy Pier. You really do need to sit up top to get the impact of the city with its fabulous skyscrapers.\\nSome of the busses stopped at each stop for far too long, particularly if in the shade as temperatures had dropped. The guides were generally good, other than pointing out certain buildings and restaurants, there wasn&acute;t a lot to say but they kept the patter going and were informative.\\nWe also took the Wendell River and Lake cruise and that showed Chicago from a different perspective so if you have time, worth doing that as well.\\nWe never had to wait too long for the next bus and we were very pleased we used Big Bus! We took the 90 minutes River and Lake Wendella boat tour and is was very good. The boat was clean, the staff helpful and the information imparted about the stunning buildings, just about right.\\nWe wanted to go on the lake as well as the river and the tour had just the right balance.\\nVery much recommended if you want an enjoyable river/lake trip with just enough detail and an excellent view of Chicago from the lake. Beautiful park all year long, with great attractions for the whole family! There is also a beautiful view of the park from inside The Art Institute! Being from St. Louis where lots of Museums and zoos are free, I&acute;m not used to paying such a high price for entry to a Museum. It was well worth it! So many amazing pieces and collections are in this museum! We only had a limited amount of time to go through everything, but I&acute;m still so grateful we did. Will definitely come back when I have more time to enjoy every area. We travelled to Chicago for a gymnastics event and spent some time shopping. No question that Water Tower Place is a great place to shop. The only issue we had was about 5:45 on Saturday night the crowd significantly changed and we noticed a greater police presence along with a definite change in vibe of the place. There were swarms of young people that basically took over the whole mall and the language that we heard was not suitable for young children and kind of ruined the whole mood. We also witnessed a young mother discipline her two year old child by taking off her belt and beating her child with it. Not great for my kids to see and there was no one of authority on that floor to intervene. I have never experienced anything like it so I would never go back at night to shop. We did the 9:30 morning architecture Segway tour with Joe and he was fantastic! Not only did we see the city, we learned a ton about Chicago and it&acute;s history! We were super lucky and it was just our family and Joe so it was like a private tour. My 12 year old son LOVED it! Won&acute;t stop talking about it! It&acute;s nice when your older kids ask to do something with you again.\\nThe Segways were easy to operate. It only too a few minutes for everyone to feel comfortable. We were able to stop and take photos, ask questions and have fun. We saw other companies while we were out, their groups were huge and there is no way they could have had the experience we had.\\nWe will do it again! Got late minute tickets for show. Pretty good hike from downtown. Show was good, venue/seating very good. Great Chicago Wine & Cheese Tour! Excellent organization, excellent food & wine, excellent service! Recommend to everyone! I have seen several productions here. It is up close and personal and ALWAYS very well done. My favorite theater in Chicago. Especially since they do shows based on historic events, people, times, etc. Don&acute;t think it means dry and boring, though. Anything but! Despite the outward appearance of the theatre, the show surpassed all our expectations. Great music and cast, Jerry Lee Lewis was a very entertaining character... The Free Concerts Programme in the Open Air Auditorium is amazing and of exceptional quality. There&acute;s a an option to picnic on the grass or sit for free. A fascinating piece of &acute;art&acute; that provides some unusual photo opportunities - You&acute;ll certainly see Chicago at a very different angle!!!!',\n",
              " 'This is an amazing way to see the whole of Dubai and decide where to go back to. The buses were very clean, staff very nice and they even provide cold water whilst on board. They have canopies on the top of the buses to keep that strong sun off your head. We did use the hop on/off service and that was great. Regular buses without the need wait long at all and always plenty of space. I strongly recommended this bus company and will use them again when we return to Dubai. Visiting Dubai from 2002 on, we have checked this new mall at our short stopover in Nov 2010. Yes it is big, yes aquarium is amazing and yes it is EXPENSIVE. Prices I was quoted for watches etc. were much higher than in EU inclusive 20% VAT. Dubai is not what in was a couple of years ago in terms of shopping... We went there to have some fun with our 3 years old daughter. She really liked it! Leap of faith was a great experience and you almost think you are free falling, good one!! :) It is catered for all ages of kids so you&acute;ll have fun for sure.\\n\\nAs we went there in November on working days (Tuesday) it was not filled with people so it was OK. Leap of faith wait was maybe 10mins, everything else almost nothing. But I can imagine it could get stressful when crowdy.\\n\\nFood/drinks are a bit expensive and be aware that it is all PRE PAID! You have to load money on your wristband by the entrance! They didn&acute;t tell me that, but a nice person did allow us to order anyway and come by later on when I did manage to go all the way back to the entrance.\\n\\nAlso be aware, that lockers are REALLY SMALL, one backpack per locker! Be prepared to wait for some of the attractions available as it can try the patience a little. The surf pool is hilarious. It beggars belief how this thing was achieved. It&acute;s absolutely mind boggling, Oddly, it&acute;s very difficult to get a partner and the Tower in the frame of the camera due to the dimensions at close range. My efforts do it no testament whatsoever. As you would expect, it&acute;s all done to music and very well done. It can get very busy for the once every half an hour showing with a lot of the locals bringing their kids along. We went to the water park for 3 days out of our 6 day stay at the Atlantis hotel as we enjoyed it so much. (Free as we were staying in the Atlantis hotel.) We rode the free golf buggy from the hotel to the far end of the water park where we always found plenty of comfy sunbeds. (Note great moveable sunshades which helped to keep us a little cooler.) We didn&acute;t go on any of the rides but spent hours on the &acute;lazy river&acute; which isn&acute;t that lazy! The beach attached to the park was fun, but we saw a number of people being treated for jelly fish stings.\\nTip - Buy a refillible drinks bottle for 40 Dirham (ВЈ8) then it is only 5 Dirham (ВЈ1) to fill up. You can use it any day you visit, not just the day you buy it. Had a great time at the top of the tower, well as high as you are allowed to go! Booked our tickets on line, saving a lot of money and went straight up. (Note all &acute;walk up&acute; tickets were sold out the day we went.) Shame there aren&acute;t many chairs to sit and watch the sunset, and a cafe is needed. But the views are great and really show how Dubai is really in the middle of the desert! We where really looking foward to seeing these, the fountain show in Vegas is great, we were so disappointed. We had dinner at a nearby restaurant, in the window and rushed out when they started at 7pm, they were over by 7.02pm! Seeing the view and just an amazing experience to be at the top Liked-The view, the ear-popping elevator ride to 124th floor.\\nDisliked-The elevator was too crowded We ate at Ping Pong restaurant and seated outside, not knowing about the fountain show. It was a spectacular 5-7 min. show. surprise. I think it started at 7 PM so be sure to be there before it starts to get a nice seat and view. I stopped in Dubai on my way to London in order to see and to ascend the Burj Khalifa. It was worth the effort. I believe it to be one of the great sights of the world, a memorable experience. You find this easy by going in to the Dubai Mall and follow the signs to Fountain.\\nWe decided to try get at table at a restaurant at the Dubai Mall Waterfront, which proved to be Wice. We got one at Urbano (just to the right on the other side of the bridge), to see the fountain from 19 when it starts and as many times as we could manage to hold on to the table. We witnessed four due to dinner and coffee. Afterdinner drinks are of course not an option here.\\nThe fountain was beautyful, shooting, spraying and dancing to music of different styles ranging from opera via Michael Jackson to local arabic. Only thing is that each show just lasts one song and then there is a pause for half an hour, though they incresed the frequency towards the ending.\\nThe atmosphere and surrondings are astonishing with a lighted Burj Khalifa as backscreen and the hole erea was packed with sheering people.\\nAnd not to forget; It&acute;s absolutely free! We didn&acute;t go up the tower. To go to the highest viewing area it was 500 dirham ($180 Australian) each!!! To go to the lower levels it was about $ 50 AUS.\\n\\nThey do a night viewing for about $ 100 AUS.\\n\\nIt&acute;s very expensive for what it is.\\n\\nI&acute;m sure the view is spectacular, but for $ 380 AUS for a couple, I&acute;m positive I have better things to spend that sort of money on. Being one of the most luxurious and tallest hotel in the world. You have to visit this place. You need to have a reservation to enter this hotel, but it will be worth it. Reservation either to restaurants, bar or checkin. We had a dinner reservation and also celebrated the birthday of our friend. We dressed up and really enjoyed our evening. Great food, great place and great experience. Even though it is costly, but still a great experience to be able to eat and see inside the most luxurious hotel in the world. My 6 year old son loved this and even me. We had the Dolphin experience and will never forget this experience. Not everyday we are able to be so close and play with the dolphins.\\n\\nOnly thing is that it was a bit expensive. Great place to visit and relax. A lot of rides if you enjoye them, basic food. We purchased tickets a day in advance, 130aed cheaper per 2 persons. A lot of sunbeads at the beach. Great fun swimming with sharks! You must buy you ticket 1 month in front, get the time you want and pay less. Very fast elevator, few seconds to 124 floor. Incredible view of the surroundings and all of Dubai! Some lessons from history of this building and city. You must do it! I&acute;ve seen a lot of wonders of this world, but i was amased by this hotel! An amazing and incredible place. Skywiev bar is a great option to spend some Dirhams! Expensive but worth it! It is not Bellagio but... Great and a lot of people around.. Loved it! After Burj Kalifa, stop at the fountains, and go shopping at Dubai Mall. This must be one of the best transit systems in the world. Modern, spotlessly clean and air-conditioned throughout. Very efficient service and reasonably priced. I would recommend paying slightly extra and going Gold class. You cannot visit Dubai without seeing the musical fountains. They are really impressive but it can get very busy so try and get there early to get a good view. The performances are every 30 minutes and well worth seeing.',\n",
              " 'Excellent day tour , our Guide was very informative and clever driver.\\nThe Stirling Castle was awesome , Lots of History in this area, besides the magnificent nature and Landscape. William Wallace memorial can be seen from this site.\\nWe made several beautiful stops, our Lunch stop was in a nice small Farm.\\nLoch Lomond is a beautiful Place , wonderful scene. I enjoyed every moment of this wonderful day trip. A lovely place if you want to escape the city life. It is quiet and filled with stunning artwork of the highest caliber. And it&acute;s free to enter! It is massive with so many interesting things. Spend a day there, visit Dolly the cloned sheep and the earth exhibitions With my bags packed and in storage at the hotel, I walked to the National Museum of Scotland to spend as many hours there as I could prior to leaving for the Edinburgh Airport. Although I had heard many good things about the museum (typically, I was told DonвЂ™t miss the museum), I was not prepared for how magnificent it is. The huge building is an amalgamation of two older buildings and a new building, and the interior is stunning, even if the architecture of the new part outside is less than inspiring. From the two former museums, there are now under one roof, collections relating to Scottish antiquities, culture and history, and collections covering science and technology, natural history, and world cultures. There is nothing musty or museum-like about this modern vibrant museum. It is hard to describe the museum; it reminds me of a cross between the Victoria and Albert (London), Franklin Institute (Philadelphia), Deutsches Museum (Munich), with a little of the Smithsonian (Washington) and the Museum of Natural History (NY) thrown in. I like museums with objects and exhibits that move. After three hours of complete absorption, I had to leave for the airport, knowing that if I come again to Edinburgh, a return visit to the National Museum of Scotland for a day to a day and a half, is an absolute must. Until I figured this one out, it was highly confusing, but once I understood how it worked, it was terrific---a must. HereвЂ™s my understanding and what I did.\\n\\nThere are five routes, five different bus names, and five different color buses, but all five routes are owned and operated by the same company. The ticket I bought (and I assume all are the same) entitled me to use all five buses. All start from the collecting point on Waverly Bridge and there are very helpful employees there to explain the operations and sell the tickets. While the routes are separate, they do intersect at several places, so that you can get off one bus at a stop, and then pick up that bus or another bus when youвЂ™re ready to hop on again. A provided map shows this clearly. I bought a 48-hour ticket which included discounted admission to the three top tourist sites: Edinburgh Castle, Hollyrood Palace and Royal Yacht Britannia. I felt it was very good value.\\n\\nWhile it is true that Edinburgh is not a huge city and many attractions are within walking distance of each other, there is no way that I would have received the breadth of experience without this bus system. I found it a must. I was expecting the RY Britannia to be good, but it was better---it was terrific. What made it so good, aside from the inherent qualities of an historic, famous and unique vessel, and the glimpse it provides into a privileged existence that we can only imagine, was the way the charitable trust that owns and operates what is now a museum, has put the whole thing together. The flow of traffic through the vessel is creative and the signage is clear and unobtrusive. The audio guides are not only informative and very interesting, but the electronics worked flawlessly. A full-time maintenance staff of 13 keeps the ship in top-notch shape, as if the royal family were about to board. It took me about 40 minutes by bus to reach the modern shopping center to which the Britannia is attached, and I found the trip through suburbs of Edinburgh interesting. I canвЂ™t imagine visiting Edinburgh without paying a visit to the Britannia. This is a really good castle, which is definitely set up for high volumes of tourists, but despite that the place still has it&acute;s character and the history of it is very interesting.\\nIt&acute;s maybe a little pricey on the entry fee, but considering how much there is to see, you don&acute;t feel like it&acute;s a rip off by the time you leave. There&acute;s a free guided tour that&acute;s run regularly as well, which is good to give you a more personalised tale of the castle&acute;s key points.\\nThe audio guide is very good, as it tells you a lot more detail about pretty much everything in there, but it&acute;ll extend your visit by a couple of hours if you listen to everything. It costs a few extra pounds for that, but if you&acute;re interested in the history of the place, rather than just wanting a look round, then it&acute;s probably worth while.\\nTry and be by the cafe for the 1 o&acute;clock gun, as that&acute;s worth seeing/ hearing, and the scottish crown jewels are interesting to see as well. And of course it&acute;s yet another place in edinburgh with fantastic views.\\nI think it took us about 4-5 hours to have a good look round (with the audio guide), and we skipped some of the museums, so make sure you give yourself a good half day for it. Don&acute;t think of this place as a museum, because it really doesn&acute;t feel like one. So although you can learn about aspects of light, images, and perspective, it&acute;s all laid out in a fun, &acute;play with it&acute; kind of way, which really works. All the exhibits are things you can get involved with, and some of them proper play with your mind.\\nThe camera obscura itself is interesting, but to fair there isn&acute;t much practical use for it, so it&acute;s limited how much the demonstrator can show it off. It&acute;s really more like a victorian parlour trick.\\nThe views from the top of the tower are great, so make use of the binoculars and telescopes they have up there.\\nIf you&acute;re in two minds whether to do this or not, like I was, then I would say do it, as I don&acute;t think you&acute;ll be dissapointed. It maybe seems a little expensive, but you&acute;ll have forgotten about that by the time you&acute;ve been round the first floor. This tour is a fun and interesting glimpse into Edinburgh&acute;s past, led by an actor tour guide. You get to see some of the original houses and streets underneath to more modern buildings near the top end of Royal Mile, with the guide telling you the stories and history behind it all. It&acute;s well organised, with knowledgable and friendly staff, although it&acute;s a little expensive. Mind you, none of the attractions in Edinburgh are particularly cheap, so if you&acute;re thinking about doing it, then it&acute;s probably worth the cash as it feels very much part of the city&acute;s character. Spent a couple of hours here to kill time before catching our flight from Edinburgh - had fun bimbling around the ruins and there are loads of nooks and crannies to explore. Would benefit from a tea room though, especially as it can get quite cold/windy! An interesting mixture of external and internal points of interest. The Crown Jewels exhibition was worth a look and the dogs&acute; cemetery was quirky! A bit cheeky to charge extra for the audio guide though. The audio guided tour of this lovely palace is just right. Not too much detail and keeps visitors moving through the rooms without too much of a crowd. It was irritating that there were large groups with a \"live\" guide giving a commentary though, as it was very off-putting when you were trying to listen to the audio guide. Britannia is berthed adjacent to the Ocean Terminal Shopping Centre in Leith. We travelled by bus from Princess Street; the 22 bus runs every 10 minutes and takes around 15-20 minutes. T\\nYou access the five decks via connecting bridges to the terminal, starting at the top deck. The audio tour lets you take as much time as you want and it&acute;s interesting to note the contrast between the &acute;Royal&acute; decks and the ones for the officers and ratings.\\nThe only negative I have is that I feel the Royal Deck Tea Rooms spoil the overall profile of the ship; could they not have been located in the terminal building? We walked up Arthur&acute;s Seat last weekend on a beautiful Sunday morning. We decided to take the longer, gentler route, along Queen&acute;s Drive eastwards passing St. Margaret&acute;s Loch and Dunsapie Loch before walking up the grassy track at the back of Arthur&acute;s Seat. The view from the summit gives you a great 360 degree view over the city.\\nWell worth the effort!',\n",
              " 'We went to the island for a nice view, micro brewery and submarine :) What we got was a nice trip with excellent beer and just outside of submarine.\\n\\nMost attractions only open in main season which was not in start of May yet so we missed most of the extra stuff. But it was worth to visit it just for the views alone as it really is a nice scenery!\\n\\nBoat trip is approx. 20 min in one way and it takes place every 20 minutes so no worries there....\\n\\nSubmarine would probably be cool, but next time for us.... Free entry. Intersting exhibitions. Nicely situated in the city centre. Always worth returning.\\nFor the moment being an exhibition on the 50&acute;s. A place to return to. Brilliant place to relax. After the dressing room (seperate for women and men) you enter in the sauna area with three types of saunas and good shours. After the showers you get dressed in your swimming suit and enter the pool area. This consists of several bassins : two for children, one with warm water and bulbs, one deep one for jumping or for water gym and two for swiming- one 25m and one 50m long.\\nAfterwards you can take a good lunch in the cafeteria facing the swiming pools. Here you get home made food and delicious Pulla. The poolhouse also consists of a gym where you can enter without reservation by paying an extra fee.\\nI love this place ! My husband & I loved the design. We couldn&acute;t stop taking photos of it. That Russian architecture was brilliant with almost a full moon. We walked up to it from the market square. It was a bit longer walk than it appeared. But worth it. Walking in the park & the streets then having a hot chocolate in one of the cafes, was a beautiful & romantic. I definitely liked the salmon dishes.\\nIt was a nice market. We shopped for souvenirs from there. I loved the location, it was beautiful. It&acute;s a must see in Helsinki. It wasn&acute;t very easy to reach. No enough signs in the streets.\\nIt had a unique structure in the rocks. It was so calm inside with the smooth music. I liked it. We visited the Uspenski Cathedral on day one of our visit to Helsinki, clearly visible from many parts of Helsinki our first visit was on a Sunday at the end of one of the mass. Inside the cathedral is well preserved and is clearly constantly being maintained. If you know nothing about orthodox christianity then this is a good place to start - steeped in history and tradition it is well worth a visit.\\nNo photos from inside on this occasion as we felt awkward about doing that while the mass was still in progress',\n",
              " 'We went to Victoria Harbour for a light show at 20:00. It was a bit foggy and A LOT OF PEOPLE. After all light show was not so impressive (fog got most of it) and due to crowds bad photo opportunities....Go at off peak hour - avoid the lightshow if you are OK with it.... Well, this is one attraction that you can&acute;t leave HK without visiting. The drive up to the peak in a double decker bus ( I was unlucky not to have the opportunity to experience the Peak Tram - as it was on its annual maintenance week) was scenic in itself, as it takes you through vignettes of HK landscape ( a maze of buildings interspersed with greenery) till you reach the Peak.\\nAt the Peak itself, the view is panoramic- and of course you need to be lucky to have a clear day...The Peak gives you a slice of HK that no other place in HK does... a comprehensive view of this city, nice relaxing options to lounge around and a variety of culinary treats\\nIt does live up to the buildup that goes with the travel to this famous place. Don&acute;t miss it! A must see if you are in Hong Kong. We visited the monastery as a package tour for the day. Included was early hotel pick up and drop off via bus to ferry. Lantau is very peaceful compared to the buzz of Hong Kong, so great if you&acute;d like to get away from the crowds. Our bus tour guide was excellent, he had been doing the tour for many years and he shared a wealth of knowledge about Hong Kong, Lantau the fishing village and the monks and monastery. A vegetarian lunch was included in our day tour prepared at the monastery. Food was beautiful, very fresh. We returned from the big Buddha via the Ngong Ping 360 chairlift - amazing views from the monastery to the bus pick up on this 5.7klm ride. We were lucky on the trip down via the chairlift to have Ngong Ping 360 employee leaving work to ride with us - she shared so much information with us about the construction of the chairlift and other top attractions to catch while on our visit to Hong Kong. A really worthwhile trip. I highly recommend to include tour in your HK adventure. Take the tram ride and your camera - birds eye view of HK harbor region. The train to The island is straightforward and from there get a cab or bus or even a tour to the villages. It really is a delight, all you need are good walking shoes, drinks and a camera. A good hat and sun cream were also essential for us this week. To get close and personal with the horses and meet the jockeys take your passport and go in through the owners and visitors entrance it&acute;s about ВЈ10 and there is no queuing. The bar and food are basic but all is clean. This entrance gives access to the paddock and course rail by the home straight and finish line which is such a treat. You need your passport to buy the tickets to the club entrance. This is an ideal way to spend an afternoon with children especially when it&acute;s in the 30&acute;s and humidity is over 80%. Our 12 year old was fully engaged with the exhibits and came away lots of knowledge. The interactive exhibits were both fun and educational, it required you to think and ask questions so we&acute;d definitely recommend two or more hours are set aside for this and it could easily be longer. Spent a few hours at Ngong Ping with transport to and from by Cable Car.\\n\\nOverall experience provided a taste of cultural and religious heritage. Had been about 7 years ago and development has been well planned and retains authentic appeal.\\n\\n(had a great kebab at Ebeneezers!,)\\n\\nAlso was very cold, much colder than expected and surrounding locales! If you are religious or not, this is an inspiring sight and the walk up is part of the rewarding journey.\\n\\nSpend the day to find yourself - go on - you deserve it. Just avoid doing it at midday in 32 degrees and 90% humidity - 2 litres of water was simply not enough!! I know that this is one of the main attraction in HK but I honestly don&acute;t understand why. I think HK has a lot more to offer than this. To me this is just a hill with expensive houses. You could get more spectacular view elsewhere. Sitting atop the island&acute;s hill amidst the busy hectic tourists clicking away. It is a sight to behold. Although when I was there in July it was terribly hot. So make sure you have a cap, a portable fan if possible and water. For god&acute;s sake do not wear heels like some of the tourists I have seen. You are going to be climbing up quite a substantial amount of stepsвЂ¦ Enjoy the view from the top! This hotel and this restaurant is simply breath taking. No joke. The view is spectacular - HK harbour view. The afternoon tea set that we had is just as wonderful. Overall, a must for every visitor to try! What a charming little village. Although as expected it is teeming with tourists. It is definitely worth a visit when you are in HK> Finally made it here after seeing most of my friends and their photos on FB. This place is beautiful. The cable car ride was good. The BUddha was spectacular. It is a fun time. Efficient enough but it is looking worn out and old much like London Underground. Infact coming from London, I feel like it is inspired by LU. If you are in town on a Wednesday. Head to the races. It is really good fun and you can get beers and hot dogs around the track. I will be back',\n",
              " 'Give this place a try on Saturday morning. We loved walking through the offerings and bought some goodies to take home. We just happened upon the market Saturday morning and it was quite fun. There were all sorts of merchants and the people were all very happy, which made us happy.\\n\\nEnjoy! What a reverent memorial. This is history that should not be missed. Normally there are many survirors of WWII at the Memorial. Read the names, be quiet and remember this is a resting place for many of our sailors. We were lucky to visit on a quiet Sunday morning when there were no bus-loads of tourist to enjoy the peaceful serenity of the cemetary. Also known as Punchbowl, it is a mini Arlington with a memorial that shows the history of the battles fought in the Pacific. Don&acute;t miss the lookout, which will give you another great vantage point to see all of southern Oahu. I was fooled into thinking it is a nice little hike--it&acute;s very challenging. It is basically train tracks and railroad ties up to the top. The trail does not meander--it is straight up one face of the crater. Many people talk about the \"bridge\"--an area where you will need to hop from one railroad tie to the next. For a person afraid of falling, it was a nightmare. But have no fear, there&acute;s a bypass trail that is on firm ground (which I knew about it on the way up). Unlike the Diamond Head Trail, there are no railings and very few place to stop along the way. The views at the top are spectacular. Make sure you take lots of water. The actual hike is not that tough as it is paved all the way up. They have improved the trail so you can bypass the long stretch of stairs near the top, the spiral staircase, and crawling through a small hole to get to the lookout. There are more spots along the way to enjoy views of both the crater, Waikiki, and east Oahu. Definitely a fun couple hours. I have been to the memorial in the past and like how they improved it. It is much more open, the museum was larger and better, and it was much more serene and befitting a memorial. Getting tickets are free but expect to wait your turn to see the movie before taking the short boat ride to the actual memorial.\\n\\nOn the boat, stay on the right side for the best pictures as you approach the memorial. Unlike my Ausrtralian beaches the Waikiki beach is so calm (no crashing waves!). Grab a floating bed or beach ring from a local ABC store for a few bucks before venturing down. Other beach activities are available for hire - sailing, water bikes, stand up paddle boards. Swimming late as 5pm felt like 2pm on Aussie beaches - very light and warm. Good for all ages. Don&acute;t forget your sunscreen! A fabulous hike to the 763-foot summit of the most famous crater off the end of Wakikki beach. You can choose to have a guided tour, or simply tackle this as I did without a guide. Breathtaking 360 degree views await you at the top. Wear a good pair of walking shoes. The terrain varies from sealed road to uneven and rocky ground. Be ready for the stairs and narrow tunnel towards the top! No water, no toilets at the top - take care of these before departing. A must do! This is a fantastic dedication and very educational. Pearl Harbour offers exhibits, displays, memorials, and museums, honouring victims of the Japanese attacks, but all of those who bravely served in World War II. Take the boat trip to the wreckage of the USS Arizona, the Memorial is a sobering experience where visitors to Hawaii come to pay their respects. So many people visit вЂ“ a good idea to reserve your tickets in advance as daily numbers are limited. We added this as a something special we would do in Hawaii and so glad we did. We chose the Eco-Star helicopter (7 seater) - as website states : more personal space, first-class individual seats, and expansive glass for exceptional visibility. This is the world&acute;s newest and most expensive model of touring helicopter. Julie was our pilot - a complete angel in the sky and so considerate to ensure all passengers get a view of everything (left and right views). In the previous week we had hired a car for 2 days and taken advantage of seeing much of the North shore and West side beaches. Also climbed Diamond Head and visited Pearl Harbour. Seeing the same from the sky in this amazing 45 minute flight recapped and gave a completely different perspective of Hawaii. Wonderful views with a great photo opportunity. An interesting lookback at the war and its impact. If you have an extra day, go for it. Oahu isint the most attractive of the islands but attractions like these make it a good package.

              " 'This is an often neglected attaraction of Istanbul- at least the Thomas Cook package that I took- did not include the Galata Tower...Luckily, a colleague of mine strongly recommended it, and we reached there on a Sunday morning after breakfast at about 1030.\\nThere was a queque of course, but it wasn&acute;t very long and we were in after 15 minutes. The view of Istanbul from the top is really worth it- you get the complete Bosphorus, the palace, the Ble Mosque et al, and it gives you the complete perspective of Istanbul&acute;s geography. Ensure you have a nice camera, with zoom and panorama , and you can take back memories packaged... ItВґs worthwhile to explore Istanbul reaching out two continents at once. The boat tours (60- 90 min) take locals here and there and you can absorb so much from this experience. Go on a sunny day.\\nMust see Istanbul fix Can you imagine a cistern built up 2000 years ago just to supply the city in a case of a siege? I recommend going there by late afternoon when you tired of getting exposed to noise, sun or other annyances, you can stay there for a while, meditate, walk around in such misterious setting. Hagia Sophia carries so much history, wisdom and it is definitely is a must for understanding history of civilization. DonВґt get bored or annoyed with lines, beggers focus on the architerural features, the arches, the colors and the mistery Despite being surrounded by about a thousand schoolchildren, the temple is large enough to accommodate everyone. It really is huge. A volunteer guide service is available inside (just beyond the ticket sales area) and our guide, notwithstanding only average English ability, was cheerful, knowledgable and enthusiastic. The Buddha is breathtaking in size. Be sure to get your enlightenment fix by crawling through the 50cm hole in the base of a column behind the Buddha. There is a reason Istanbul Eats ranks so highly among TripAdvisor attractions. It is a well-run organization with guides who clearly know their stuff. Booking online was simple, acknowledgement quick and, because Daylight Saving Time kicked in the day of our tour, we were sent a reminder of the change. Our tour was Two Markets, Two Continents and our guide Senem started our group of eight with tea, tahini biscuits, simit (bagel) and goat cheese in a wonderfully dusty and utilitarian caravansaray located behind the Kadakoy waterfront. From there we wandered through backstreets to sample water buffalo cheese/honey (kaymak) and to visit the neighbourhood&acute;s preeminent baklava maker. A couple of hundred metres later we arrived at the ferry dock and it was off across the Bosphorus to the similar-sounding Asian neighbourhood of Karakoy to wander for a couple of hours through streets oozing with character and good food. We sampled EVERYTHING. Sure, not everyone was initially keen to try fresh anchovies, candied olives or pickle juice, but that was part of the fun. Learn about it, try it, decide if you like it. We visited one interesting and delicious place after another and after five hours we were full of information (not to mention Turkish cuisine). Add to this food experience Senem&acute;s great ability to talk about local customs, history, architecture, prices and politics and it was a terrific day out. We cannot recommend this highly enough. p.s. take a pocket notebook and a camera if you want to make sense of this amazing array of sights, sounds and tastes. It&acute;s early spring and the tulips are in full bloom. The park is lovely and the flowerbeds well groomed. It is the perfect place for a walk or runвЂ¦ in the early morning. At 9:00 a.m. we had the park pretty much to ourselves, but when we walked past the entrance in the late afternoon we looked in and could not see far because of the crowds. If you are en route to somewhere the park can be entered from either end. We did the Golden Horn with Kemal at the end of March this year. We did some landscape from the old city walls, the bird market and walked through the old greek neighbourhoods, All in all, a recommended tour to see a different part of the city. Kemal is knowledgable, his assistant is helpful and we picked up some interesting tips along the way. I particularly enjoyed the street photography at the old neighbourhoods and cafe&acute;s.\\n\\nNo complaints. I would&acute;ve given five bobs but I&acute;ve been on a lot of photo tours in many cities across the world and on a sliding scale I thought I picked up more on a couple of other tours. That&acute;s not to take away from this tour - you will thoroughly enjoy it if you decide to for it. We had Serif for a couple of days in Istanbul at the end of March this year and we don&acute;t regret a moment of it. There is nothing to add that hasn&acute;t already been said in other reviews. Serif&acute;s knowledge is unparalleled, his passion for the city unmatched. Tell him your interests in advance and leave the day planning for him to work out and take you around this great city. We also appreciated the local restaurants where we ate over the 2 days. We were very clear that we wanted to eat where the locals ate and didn&acute;t care if they were small hole-in-the-wall joints. The food was phenomenal!\\nWe also included a trip to the Grand Bazaar and contradictory to another reviewer, did not feel pressured at all to purchase anything from any of the stores there.\\n\\nAll in all, highly recommended. What can I say that hasnt already been said about this tour. The booking process was seamless - Leisa is knowledgable and helpful. I&acute;m not going to say about the food - there is nothing new to say about - IT IS EXCEPTIONAL. I&acute;m going to talk about my overall experience. We booked the twilight on Taksim tour on our first night - however, we were jet lagged after a transcontinental flight and a late lunch. We made the tour but unfortunately were in no position to finish it. Half way thorough the tour we were too full and too tired to continue. Korhan offered to cut the tour short and let us continue on another day for the remaining on another day at no extra cost! We gladly accepted the offer and joined him again the next day. Fortunately for us, we were the only people on the tour on both days and got complete attention from Korhan. Korhan knows his food and is passionate about his country. Must do on your trip to Istanbul. If you only have 3 hours in Istanbul and your choice is between this tour and seeing the blue mosque, I suggest you take this tour. This is the underground damp structure you&acute;ve seen in spy movies as the clandestine meeting point for the protagonist and villain. Its an impressive structure, watch your footing around damp floors, don;t expect to get any good photos in the low light. However, a must if in Istanbul. Factor at least a couple of hours if you want to see everything properly. Its an impressive monument and some good bit of history on display. Get a guide if you truly want to understand the culture and history and relate to the structure, otherwise its just another palace. Its a mosque, its big, its blue, has a huge queue to get in on any day of the week and is overcrowded inside. Impossible to get a photo without at least 50 other people in your frame. Yes, the ceramic tile work is impressive but overall totally underwhelmed. Much better from the outside to see the scale and some good photo ops with the structure in the background. This is an impressive monument but the metal reinforcements inside cover almost half the interiors and render it unaccessible. Our guide told us that its been this way for years and is likely to remain for many more. I&acute;m not sure what they are constructing, but its a dampener on the experience and photo ops. ???????? ?? ???? ? ????? ????? ????? ?????????, ??????? ????? ? ??????????. ???? ????? ???? ????????????? ????? ??????. ???????? ??????????? ???????????? ? ????? ?????????? ?????? ??? ???????. ??? ????? ?????? ?????? ??? ?? ??????? ????????? ?? ???????. ???????, ????????, ???????, ?????????. ???????? ???? ????? ???????, ?? ??? ?????? ???????? ??????? ??? ?????????. ????????? 85 ??? ?? 3 ??? ??? 115 ??? ?? 5 ????. ????? ?????, ??? ?????? ??? ??????? ? ??????????? ??????? ????? ???????? ??? ???? ??????. ???? ? ??? ???????, ? ???? ?? ??? ?????????. ??????? ??? ??????? ?????? ?????? ? ???????????? ????. ????? ???????? ?????. ? ????????? ? ???????? ????????? ??????? ???????? ?????? ?? ?????, ? ?? ????? - 30 ???, ??? ???????. ?????? ???????? ???????? ?????????, ?? ??????? ?? ???? ? ????? ??? ?? ?????????. Nothing special here if you&acute;re used to large shopping centres anyway. The Turks seem to be very enamoured of it though and it does sell things that you don&acute;t get in smaller Turkish towns. I was there in February 2014 and they still have a huge Christmas tree (!?) on the ground floor, placed very prominently beside a stage where entertainment for kids was going on. The centre has plenty of shops (one reviewer claimed it is \"small\" - not sure what she&acute;s used to, but it can&acute;t be described as \"small\"). It&acute;s a huge shopping centre filled with the usual household names we&acute;re all used to seeing in western society, has a 6-screen cinema, bowling alley, big entertainment area for kids and, as I said earlier, entertainment was laid on the day I visited. Throngs of kids (and adults) crowded round the stage while \"Gangnam Style\" etc was played and they all seemed to really enjoy the Butlin&acute;s style Red Coat entertainment with many watching from the floors above. The noise was deafening however and could easily be heard all over the centre - not what I&acute;d call a relaxing Sunday shopping. There is the usual food court, again with all the well-known names - KFC, Burger King etc. Very clean and modern and good if you like these kind of shopping experiences. Frankly, I didn&acute;t enjoy it much, as I can see this kind of thing anywhere in the UK. I was taken here by a well meaning friend for shopping as the Grand Bazaar is closed on a Sunday!',\n",
              " 'First time here and I fell in love! Our hotel has his art all over and I was ecstatic when I found the gallery on Duval St. The serenity carried throughout his work is peaceful and very inviting. This gallery is so invigorating and refreshing. I have been following Peter&acute;s work for several years now and he never ceases to amaze me! The staff is friendly and very informative. I always look forward to coming back here to see what&acute;s new on their wall! Our couples massage was about 20% less than what the resorts charge and we thought it was very good. We went for the first time and loved it, very well worth the admission fee. Although it is not large we spent 1/2 hour enjoying the butterflies and I am sure it would be great for kids. The drive down to Key West and back is quite simple, you stay on US 1 until you are there. Along the way are great photo opportunities like the bridges and small keys that hold them up. Don&acute;t forget to have your camera ready, there&acute;s no stopping on the bridge so you&acute;ll have to take photos on the fly.\\nTraffic can be bad when you are nearing the mainland but once you are past Marathon it&acute;s a breeze. On the water front, can&acute;t beat the view, close to town.\\nAfternoons/sunset gets busy, get here early and enjoy. The Fort is very close to town and that is very convenient. We rented bikes and zipped in and out through out the day (waited for guided tour and the afternoon sun to warm up the sand). Clean and well worth the visit. I find the best spots in Key West are not on Duval. The Green Parrot is a prime example. Never seems overcrowded and just full of character.',\n",
              " 'Sited within the main botanical gardens area of KL, near the bird park. This small orchid garden gives a nice break from the bustle of the city. Entrance is free, so worth a visit. You can comfortably see the whole garden in an hour though, so this isn&acute;t a big trip out! The people in the little shops were very friendly and kind. We didn&acute;t really like it compared to central market for example. The entrance is quite OK if you ignore all the people bothering you with \"You need DVD sir?, You need games sir?....\" but then pathways soon become narrower and narrower and narrower and suddenly you can hardly squeeze in....We really do not like such tight crammed places where you can not normally walk if someone comes in opposite direction.\\n\\nGoods? Nothing special.... We usually ended our day in Berjaya as it was just 10 minutes walk from our hotel (or 2 monorail stations away). It has HUGE selection of everything and you have a very nice asian food court in the lower grounds if you feel like experimenting with all kind of asian food! It&acute;s very cheap and you can see most of the food too! Take a note! The glass bridge in between is CLOSED until December due to works! I went there on our last day very early in the morning (7am) as we had to go to airport on same day and it was very nice as there were almost no people anywhere around so I could really make some great photos! Well my hotel was 5 minutes walk away so I could do it so early :) Well how to start...We have went to the bird park primarily due to planned visit to Orchid Park (which is across the street and has free entry). The entry fee is quite high (compared to other entry fees in Malaysia that is) and I was not sure I got what I paid for.\\n\\nWe have certainly enjoyed the free flying birds, but the rest of the birds is still in cages and looking into dense gridded cages is just not such fun as to come eye-2-eye with free birds. So actually after some 15 minutes we were \"bored\" already as we have seen a lot of birds already in Zoos around the world (maybe that was the reason of why we were not so impressed).\\n\\nBird show was OK, but then again you saw one, you saw them all....We left 5 minutes before it actually ended.\\n\\nAl in all, I would recommend the visit to families with children, bird lovers and keen photographers (very good photo opportunities).\\n\\nTaxi from city centre to the Bird Park was 15RM. Back to City Centre it was 18RM from Taxi Counter. You first need to endure a PR pitch on the oil&gas company, then you travel up an elevator to see the surrounding areas. Go to the Lobby Bar at the Hyatt, at least yoiu can enjoy a drink ????????, ???????, ???????? ???????? ?????, ??? ?? ??????? ????? ??????????? ???. ???????????? ???????????, ?????????????? ??????, ?????????, ????. ???????? ? ??????? ???????? ?

It&acute;s best to have dinner at the rotating Restaurant on this Tower. The food buffet is delicious, the ambience is seriously romantic, the view is stunning. Truly an experience to behold. Love this! It is super fast and have wireless access which is great when you are a tourist and need to go online and check your emails. The train itself is spanking new and wonderful! What a fun experience. The guides were very friendly and the little tour was insightful. The view was okay. I suspect that the KLCC is a better sight than the surrounding.',\n",
              " 'Having a soft spot for steam locomotives I have to be as objective as possible when writing this. The museum is small, but pretty amazing. Many rail museums have one or two working steam locomotives - this place has several. Located a 15 minute walk from Kyoto Station, the museum sits on a short curving section of track mothballed from the nearby main lines. It is surrounded by today&acute;s technology and modern trains zip past every few minutes. It is small museum, so 45 minutes to an hour is plenty. Take your camera, as there are many opportunities to photograph the technology of years past. Although most of the museum plaque text is in Japanese, there is some boilerplate (sorry, bad pun) English information. An informative short video just inside the entrance shows how a steam loco works and a cab with lifelike chugging and steam whistle sounds allows one to make an amusing short video. 10-minute rides in open-sided cars behind the locomotive (backwards for about 700 metres, then forwards to the start point) run every couple of hours, but even if one does not ride, there is the ability to smell the coal smoke and listen to the whistle. Yeah, it&acute;s not a big place, but it is as good a period museum as any. On arrival we were despairing of fighting the crowds, as the train was swarmed with students on a day trip. We made our way to the main shrine buildings and spent little time in the main square, as the place was PACKED. All our photos there were shot over the heads of the crowd. Walking the first few hundred metres through the torii gates was like riding the metro during rush hour, but as we climbed higher the numbers decreased, as noted by previous reviewers. Don&acute;t bother with photos for the first 15 minutes of the uphill hike, as there will be long uncrowded gate vistas later. We took several photos of hundreds of gates with nobody in sight. If you are planning to ascend to the top, there is no view from there; rather, the best view of Kyoto comes at the junction where up and down trails meet. This was an average temple largely because the rains played spoilsport, do read up before you visit the shrines, because you need to know what is it that you are visiting beforehand to appreciate it better. The main-gate was beautiful (i guess it is called the \"Sanmon\") and by paying about 500Y you get to inside and climb up the gate, very touristy:-p a great temple, but an excellent rating is largely for the Hanami street (if i have spelled it correctly) around the temple to observe the real Geishas in action, a great place for picture taking. I went arounf 9pm and we saw quite a few geishas walking to these member-only houses for work i presume. Get a good camera and practice your \"quick-shot\" skills before hand, coz the Geishas move fast!! Intriguing history about the shrine/ the main gate (Apparently the chief designer of the main gate committed suicide because he overshot the budget for constructing the Shrine). The Steps behind the gate and the gardens were a great resting place. Also the Garden had its lone but fully bloomed Cherryblossom tree which was great to capture some great pictures Like my review for Kiyomizu Temple, do not miss anything in the Higashiyama area ie around Kiyomizu, Yasaka Shrine and Gion! this is the realy feeling of Kyoto! and a great splace for good restaurants, geishas, look-aloke geishas, souvenirs and ATMOSPHERE Pretty Shrine like most of the others, the gardens are picturesque, my photo got runied coz some workers were changing some covers on the windows of this structure in blue overalls :-(... but dont miss it!! I have always wanted to visit Fushimi Shrine and it did not disappoint. What wonderfully peaceful and appetite inducing climb through the torii gates to the top.\\nPlenty of stalls for street snacks along the way.',\n",
              " 'The park has few nice things. Climbing artificial rocks for smaller kids. The park is very busy.\\nWhile it has a lot of trees and nice grass it could be cleaner.\\nParking lot is always busy. I like that park a lot. There&acute;re lots of birds living there. Kids love to look at them and chase geese and ducks.\\nThere&acute;re few playgrounds for different ages. It is good place for jogging too. Ponds make me feel relaxed. Park is surrounded by tall trees. Love it. I don&acute;t think it is big amusement as I have music in the car. This road is rarely traveled. The only interesting place around there is Apollo Park. It is very unusual for this area. It is the only walking street in town. Lots of little shops and a museum. My kids love to climb rocks. This is the best place to do it. The winds are going crazy at this area during winter and early spring, but it is great in summer. It has a trail about an hour and a half walk. Great view of San Bernardino Mountains and Angeles National Forest State Park. There&acute;s a BBQ area. Great for weekend getaway! We visited Lancaster for the first time earlier this week and had a chance to take the walking tour of downtown Lancaster. I totally recommend it. The tour originates at the visitors center and leaves at 1:00 p.m. There is a nominal fee for the tour. Our tour guide was a professor emeritus from Temple Univ. He was very knowledgeable about the history and architecture of Lancaster and we learned a lot from him. The tour runs for about one hour. We visited historic and preserved buildings, an 18th century church, and the lobby of the Marriott Hotel among other places. The faГ§ade of the hotel includes the front of a former department store and a brick wall from a former building on the right side of the hotel. Creative urban preservation at its best! The only time in my life I can remember anything about Wheatland was from a stamp issued by the USPS in the 1950&acute;s. I am so glad we got a chance to visit Wheatland a few days ago as it made me better understand and appreciate a former president who is one of the more obscure and least revered of our chief executives.\\n\\nWheatland is located in a quiet residential section of Lancaster and is located in a park like setting set back from the road with a wide expanse of front lawn. Located in the front corner, kind of hidden is a frog pond created as a tribute to Buchanan who expressed a love for frogs and a desire to return to earth as a frog. A little gurgling brook runs into it. The tour starts with a short introductory video in a little administration building next to the house. There is an admission charge with a separate admission charge for the small museum in that building. Walking down to the house we were greeted by a guide in period costume. She was delightful, gracious and informative. The house itself is a mansion and has lots of Buchanan&acute;s furniture and other items. He lived there prior to his presidency and then afterward until he died in 1868. He never married but lived with a niece and her husband. Next to the house is his law office where he practiced before entering politics. During the course of the hour long tour, one learns a lot about him. He was a man of very high principle and a very strict interpreter of the Constitution. He admittedly was the wrong person to be in office during the tumultuous years leading up to the civil war as he could not bring the sides to any sort of a compromise. He was by no means a bad person or a bad president, he was just unable to deal with the national tensions due to his reliance on the strict interpretation of the Constitution. He did not run for a second term.\\n\\nFor history buffs and anyone wanting to learn about a largely forgotten figure, a visit to Wheatland is a pleasure. We visited Central Market on Tuesday and were fortunate we were in Lancaster on a day it is open (Tues., Sat., and Sun.) The market reminds me of central markets found in Europe such as ones we visited this summer in Stockholm and Copenhagen. Visiting the market in August is a special treat as virtually all of the produce is fresh from the local farms and Amish countryside. There are dozens of vendors with fresh vegetables, bakery goods, locally sourced meats and poultry, dairy and ready-to-eat food available. There are also artisans selling potholders and other household handcrafted items, and lots of home-produced honey, jams & jellies, chow chow, pickles and other goodies to take home.\\n\\nIt is fun to wander up and down the aisles taking it all in. We bought a lot of items that were boxed to store in the car for the ride home. If I lived in the area I would do all my food shopping there as everything looked so good. Prices were much lower here than in Europe and the quality matched it, if not bettered it. The workers in the food stalls were all quite friendly. Don&acute;t miss this if you are in Lancaster!',\n",
              " 'It is a mix of all you can find at Vegas, from Cirque De SOleil type acrobatics to juggling, comedy and impersonations. Oddly, no women in the cast. We got tickets for 1/2 price from Vegas.com. I would not recommend it for the fullprice tickets though.\\nThe theater is small so unless you insist on being in the front, no need. More likely to be picked on in fact if you do sit in the front. It is kid friendly. This is a review of Grand Canyon West Rim as \"per se\" not any tour company. As West rim is the closest to Vegas, we headed there with a car by ourself. The road is OK and marked good, it also looks quite new and the last couple of miles. It was quite a bad day actually to go to Grand Canyon (rain, fog...) but it was our last option and well we went.\\n\\nArriving there, we noticed a \"guard post\" where they redirected us to a inflated building for \"tickets\". As we did not want to do anything with Skywalk, we said we just want to drive to the canyon rim and have a look. No no.....Still go inside.\\n\\nIn the Indian run center we found out you CAN NOT IN ANY WAY COME CLOSE TO GRAND CANYON NATURAL FORMATION WITHOUT PAYING MONEY. This is OUTRAGEOUS. I understand they want money for Skywalk, but only to have a look at something naturally formed? At least they admitted there is just fog to be seen anyhow and we thus said \"Thank you\" and left. Driving for 2 hours and a half without even a glimpse of the canyon. As far as I understand there is no problem to see the canyon for free from other points (after all canyon is huge), but those points are at least 4-5hrs away from Vegas.\\n\\nWe should have listened to a local lady in Vegas, that told us \"do not go to west rim\", but we did;t really have an option for anything else.\\n\\nSo I urge you visitors, go get info on Grand canyon, find a better spot and enjoy free views of natural wonders!\\n\\nNo offence to Indian people running the facility, but you pushed it too far with fencing off something as Grand Canyon. Everybody does and you can hardly miss it as it is on the strip and seen from a walkway :) Real treat for eyes and FREE :) If idea of shooting automatic weapons appeals to you, you should definitely come here!!! In most of the EU countries automatic weapon is forbidden and there is no way to shoot it at all and if you add the huge collection to the equation, this is THE opportunity to do it. I decided for \"Wehrmacht Package\" compromised of historic German WWII machine guns and extra rounds of .50BMG. I loved the opportunity to see this old historic pieces and try to shoot with them and it was just amazing. The 50cal was a WOW on top, boy that thing put smiles on our faces for hours :)\\n\\nWith a free pickup with Humvee at the hotel it is not a logistical problem to go there and guys were really friendly as was the young guy at the reception desk, that helped us with RPG photos :) In between guys prepared the trolley with our guns and ammo and we went to the range. Short instructions for each rifle and you pull the trigger and off goes the biggest smile on faces you ever saw :)\\n\\nGo for what you can&acute;t shoot at home would be my advice and be sure to fire at least one .50BMG as you will NOT be disappointed :)\\n\\nMy all time favorite gun was MG-15, basically an old anti aircraft machine gun. The sound was amazing!!! Went to Dream Racing with a couple of friends to fulfill the childhood dreams of all those Lambos and Ferraris :) We were a bit late, but there was no problem and we were greeted warmly and followed the program. A bit of upselling offers at first, but not too pushy.\\n\\nAfter the theory and the simulators, which are REALLY HELPFUL as you do not waste valuable time on the track itself we hit the racetrack and the cars. What a ride that was, it is over really quickly, but you will be quite exhausted :) A lot of photo opportunities and friendly staff. Advice to tall people -> Lambos are tiny....\\n\\nAfter the whole event, we came back to the center, where we got opportunity to buy our pics with the cars for a HEFTY price of $25. Come on, it is a digital print of otherwise quite nice picture, but $25!? They should price it somewhere like $10-$15 and would probably sell 3x more instead of throwing already printed pictures in garbage.\\n\\nOnboard video is filmed and you can purchase it for ~$50 (with tax), which is also a bit too much if you ask me. You also do not see video at all before purchase.\\n\\nI was also a bit baffled that there were no track times measured, so I had no clue whatsoever of how we did or even what was the fastest achieved speed...Shame, would be interesting to know.\\n\\nSo 4 stars yes. 5 stars no, there is room for improvement. this is one of many providers of the tours to Grand Canyon from Vegas. The start was early and we were collected from hotel pick up point and taken to central office where we were put into another bus. All fine, then we started our journey to the Grand Canyon with a stop over at Hoover dam, post that there was another unnecessary stop made where we ended up wasting about 45 min.\\n\\nThen we stopped for lunch and post that into the Grand Canyon.\\n\\nthe driver was quite knowledgeable and funny, the bus was quite comfortable though became a bit chilly due to high aircon while on our way back.\\n\\nWe could have come back a bit earlier or got more time at the Grand Canyon as the extra stop on the way was not really needed. Other than that, no complains !! As my title says, I&acute;m not a Titanic fan, yes, saw the movie, etc. However, seeing the way this exhibit explained some of the lives and actually seeing things from over 100 years ago was thrilling and awesome. My 10 year old daughter (also not a Titanic fan) loved this exhibit and took away an important part of history. I&acute;m not going into great details what you&acute;ll see, however, do go to it before it leaves in five years. My 10 year old daughter and myself took this day trip to the Grand Canyon Western Rim from Las Vegas while my husband was at a conference (he didn&acute;t want to see the Canyon). It was a 3 hour trip there but several stops along the way. We were picked up promptly from our hotel and provided a boxed breakfast (apple, muffin, orange juice, crackers). We stopped at Eagle Point and went on the Skywalk which really was an amazing experience. We wore booties and couldn&acute;t take extras or our own pictures (they provide free lockers). However, highly recommend having them take lots of pictures of you and purchasing the flash drive, which contains extra stunning pictures they&acute;ve professionally taken at other times of the skywalk for your use, i.e. rainbows, lightning shots, etc. The lunch provided on this tour at Guano Point was very good. And the views for us first timers were stunning. Highly, highly recommend this trip. We stopped by the Joshua Tree forest on the way back for quick photos and returned to Las Vegas by 4 p.m. We really didn&acute;t need much more time than that and were able to enjoy another evening in Las Vegas. We arrived at 10:30 p.m. Took over 2 hours to get to the Monte Carlo. The lady shuttle driver didn&acute;t know where she was going for part of the trip. Had a little girl with us. Very terrible experience.\\n\\nShuttle returning to the airport days later was prompt and efficient. Took less than 1/2 hour to get to the airport. Obviously lady shuttle driver was clueless and we paid the price.\\n\\nWill use a different shuttle service in the future. BellTrans used to be more reliable. This taught us otherwise. From arrival to departure you&acute;ll love this place. It&acute;s all about entertainment and this place has it in abundance. This is a must on a visit to Nevada. The size and scale of the canyons is immense. I flew by plane to the tops and sky walk area but wished I&acute;d taken the helicopter ride to the base. This is more expensive but I&acute;d imagine the best way to get the best views. Brilliant fountain show to music half hourly from 3pm to 8pm then every 15 minutes until midnight. A must see I have expected a lot from this show. I have already seen Reve in Wynn a few years ago. This show is really nice but it is a bit less structured so I found it hard to follow what was going on.\\n\\nAnyhow... if you can afford it, go, but I think the other show in Wynn is better. My wife and I attended the show and really enjoyed it. We last saw Penn & Teller live about 30 years ago, so some of the illusions were repeats...but that&acute;s ok. I was trying to figure out the \"trick\" and they still were able to amaze us.\\nThere are a number of new routines in this act as well, so it kept the show fresh.\\nThe pre-show jazz was a nice touch, we weren&acute;t going to come in until the last minute but I&acute;m glad we made it to watch the duo play...especially the bass player (I&acute;ll keep that a secret).\\nIf you enjoy magic, this is a great show. Penn can pontificate a bit at times, but that&acute;s ok...that&acute;s just Penn. Went here with a couple of friends had a brilliant time the weather was good! thought we might look out of place as we didn&acute;t have any kids with us but we didn&acute;t,glad we hadn&acute;t think we would have spent a lot of time looking for them!& some parts are a bit frightening! There doesn&acute;t seem to be enough toilets other than that everything was great fabulous day out! This was our fourth visit it is always exciting you never know what you are going to see! We were happy to see that everywhere was nice & tidy most of it has had a make-over since we were last there a few years ago, the linq is great very nice eateries bars & a few shops on the way to the high roller which we didn&acute;t ride it looked good though! This was fun, I wish it was longer! My only complaint was that I wish the harness was longer. They were out of the &acute;tall&acute; version so I had bruises from it the next day. Will I do it again? you bet!!! I was a bit concerned about going to see Penn & Teller because I&acute;m a bit of a prude. I don&acute;t swear and don&acute;t like to hear a lot of swearing. And raunchiness? Not a fan of that either. The little I knew about Penn & Teller led me to believe that the show would be raunchy and a bit vulgar. I couldn&acute;t have been more wrong. From the time we walked into the theater until we left I was laughing and smiling the entire time. The magic tricks were amazing. They were sure to offer tips to attendees that magic isn&acute;t real. This, quite possibly, is the best show I&acute;ve sen in Las Vegas. I&acute;m not sure that it would hold up to a second viewing, but the first one was great fun. If you&acute;re stuck with a choice between La Reve and O, I highly recommend you choose O. That being said, La Reve is not a bad show. It&acute;s really quite good. The acrobatics are absolutely amazing. And the theater in the round thing makes it feel rather intimate. What I didn&acute;t like was that it was too sexual. It seemed that every number was someone trying to seduce another person or a woman writhing around suggestively on the floor. It just got to be too much for me and by the end I just wanted the show to be over. Admittedly I am a bit of a prude. So you may not be bothered by this.\\n\\nThe overtly sexual content aside, the show seems as though it&acute;s written to be more accessible to people who might be put off by the loftiness of Cirque shows. I, myself, missed that loftiness. And several times I thought to myself that there was a Thunderdome element to the show...not the 2 men enter, 1 man leaves...but that it was dark and not somewhere I would want to be.\\n\\nAgain, it&acute;s not a bad show. I give it 4 green circles. I won&acute;t however, be returning to see it. I will see O again...for the third time. I am English and have just visited Las Vegas. I looked forward to seeing Elton John in the larger than life Las Vegas environment. All I wanted was to see Elton John and listen to him sing and play. Something he does and did well. This show was so offensive and particularly to women. I notice one review says not to focus on the video screen, with Elton sat on the left of the stage and the video taking centre stage it is very hard to focus on anything other than the props. The weird show detracts from the performance and god knows what was going on in his head when he allowed footage of dying solders, suicide attempts and the burning of women&acute;s private parts to go ahead. I am the same age as Elton and can remember paying peanuts to see him. A young woman of 26 who was at the concert had the same view as me, so I am not a grumpy old woman. I realise he has had a few knocks in life, but hey haven&acute;t we all? come Elton get over yourself and earn your crust. I have just read reviews from his concert last week in Yorkshsire, UK. down the road from where I live. No mention of offensive props and videos just admiration for his performance. I can only assume that his UK tour will be more traditional and I advise Elton to stick to that in future.\\n\\nDon&acute;t go to Vegas to see Elton come over to the UK where he would never get away with the rubbish shown in Las Vegas.\\n\\nI also didn&acute;t like the cronies getting up and dancing around the piano. I didn&acute;t pay $194 to see someones fat [--]. So much fun and worth the money!!! When we first looked this up it seemed a little overpriced especially based on only shooting a low number of rounds in each gun, but it&acute;s extremely entertaining, a very unique experience, and a great way to spend an afternoon. Watch out for the kick on that .50 cal!!! Incredible artists, magnificent theater! Clowns are a nice filler but the atletes will take your breath away! Trapeze and jumping in to the water are surreal. No wonder it is sold out so long.\\nGREAT!! Extreme fun, great memories. Very nice idea to spend 2- 3 hours.. but my hand hurt for 2 days... ;-)) American muscle car was the best thing to do in Vegas! Mustang Shelby is incredible, Corvette and Dodge are great to. Next time in Vegas, i will take 4 Muscle cars!! Staff is very well trained and nice to all drivers.\\nExcess of fun! Great show after bronchitis.. Superb band, talented musicians. Loved all songs! Colosseum is excellente place. Perfect show! I normally don&acute;t review entertainment, much less free entertainment, but if you&acute;re looking for a show so terrible that it wraps all the way around the spectrum of badness and becomes nearly an act of comic genius... well, then the Sirens of TI may be for you. Read on for more:\\n\\nFirst, let&acute;s give some credit to the actors, who clearly know that their careers may have beached themselves on the reef of this show, and are gosh-darnit going to make the most of what&acute;s left. Their energetic and enthusiastic dancing almost completely covers for the fact that they don&acute;t even bother trying to lip-sync the soundtrack.\\n\\nWhere once the British Navy sailed in to try and hang the dastard pirates from the nearest yard-arm, now a scantily clad sea-kitten named \"Sin\" hangs a shirtless cabin boy from manacles attached to the mast. Meanwhile, her coven of French and Spanish-accented jezebels belt out excerpts from songs that America&acute;s Top 40 rejected, in an attempt to burst the eardrums of the cabin boy&acute;s rescuers, and drive them into the sea. There is little wonderment when their soggy plot succeeds, because I&acute;d have gladly thrown myself into the nearest body of water just to make them STOP SINGING.\\n\\nBut wait! There&acute;s more... The now-moistened pirates swim away from their ruined craft, and climb aboard the SS Tart to engage in 4-minutes of dance-fighting that does to swordplay what Simon Cowell has done to quality TV. At the end of this confused mess, you&acute;re left with the impression that somehow, these sworn-enemies have suddenly decided to go below decks for a bit of steamy and unsanitary coupling. At least, that is until one last pirate comes to his senses and throws himself into the water for no reason whatsoever.\\n\\nThere&acute;s fireworks. There&acute;s flashing lights. There&acute;s music with all the quality and memorability of a sharp stick in the ear. Infants between the ages of 8-18 months will probably find it mesmerizing. Anyone older will find themselves longing for the days when cheesy pirates and low-budget effects dominated the north end of the Strip...\\n\\nKenny Ortega (also the director of High School Musical) should be even more ashamed of himself for inflicting the Sirens of TI on society, than he should be for inflicting High School Musical... The owners of the trendily re-branded TI should be honored for finding a way to re-make a Vegas resort that involves imploding their patrons&acute; frontal lobes, instead of imploding the aging casino itself.\\n\\nDo yourself and your sanity a favor and skip this one. Only on for a couple of minutes and its over before you know it. Very crowded so you need find a spot 30 mins the next show only to see something that lasts a couple of mins. Skip it. The Neon Museum Tour is a guided tour that runs for approx 45 minutes. The Neon boneyard as lots of old neon signs mainly from Fremont Street but also some from the Flamingo and Bills Gambling Saloon. The tour guide was very knowledgable about the history of the signs and as a volunteer she was very passionate about this topic. The best time to do this tour is at 10am as it gets hot in the sun and there is very little shelter If you&acute;re a KISS fan you must play a around of mini golf at KISS Monster Golf. We used a BOBO voucher from the 2013 American Casino Guide and paid $14 for both of us. The indoor golf is 18 holes, glow in the dark with great props all through the course. Whilst the course isn&acute;t big its a lot of fun with KISS music playing throughout the centre. We spent about an 1hr playing and we were encouraged to take as many photos as we wanted to while we were there.\\n\\nThere is a small wedding chapel, shop and displays there as well. We had a great time and will definately play another round next time we are in Vegas! This was our second visit to the Mix Lounge at Mandalay Bay as we wanted to take friends here to see the view of the Strip from the 64th floor.\\n\\nIt was a Thursday night and it wasnt that busy. We had 2 for 1 drinks which was great.\\n\\nOur server was great, she was probably the most down to earth nice table server we have come across unlike many of the pretentious false others. (couldnt remember her name)\\n\\nYou can sit at the table (no charge) and take in the view which is second to none and is the best in Vegas. You can also go out on the balcony but cant take your drinks outside.\\n\\nThe only draw back was the music, the acoustics in the venue are shocking and the DJ was poor. How he can work a crowd when he cant even see the dancefloor is beyond me. (The DJ booth is nowhere near the dance floor)\\n\\nView - Excellent\\nDJ - Poor One of my girlfriends and I saw the Chippendales on Nov. 4. Let me just say that it was pure craziness! I was surprised how small the theatre is, so you really got up close & personal with the guys. The dancing isn&acute;t perfect, and I could have done without the singing/rapping, but these boys are hotttttt and so much fun to watch! We had almost as much fun watching the other women as we did the guys -- they were like a pack of wild predators LOL!\\nI feel like this is something every girl should see in Vegas... so much fun! We literally laughed the entire time... Check it out for yourself! I&acute;ve been a Britney fan since I was 14 years-old and she came out with her first song. One of my girlfriends and I went to Vegas for a girls getaway and Britney Spears was at the top of our list of shows to see.\\nYes she lip-synchs, no she can&acute;t dance like she used to, but overall we had a really good time! It was actually better than I expected it to be. The show is well done with the lights & props and her dancers were amazing, which probably helped a lot.\\nThis is my only issue: We went to the concert on Nov 5, which was Britney Day in Vegas. She was given a key to the city and had a big meet & greet with fans at the Linq earlier the day. We were disappointed that she didn&acute;t even acknowledge this during the show. Actually, she barely even interacted with the audience at all. Anything she did say to the crowd seemed kind of robotic and scripted, like she&acute;d said it a thousand times before. Oh well, I suppose we didn&acute;t go to hear her speak....\\nAll that aside, we had an awesome time re-living our teenage-hood and I would totally go see her again. If you&acute;re not a Britney fan it will probably not be your cup of tea, but we had fun and ended up at Liaison after the show for the Britney afterparty -- what an awesome night THAT was... But that&acute;s a whole other story! ;) ;)',\n",
              " 'After reading all the hype about this show, I thought I would have to get tickets and check it out for myself. There was a long wait for tickets, to get decent seats; plan to book well in advance.\\nThe wait was well worth it. Everything about this show was excellent, the storyline, the music, the sets, the acting. It was hands down the best musical I have seen. Entertaining in every way.\\nWhen I left the theatre, I was wishing I could see it again! If you&acute;re interested in war history and/or Churchill, this is an absorbing visit. If you&acute;re not, and you&acute;re just doing it for the sake of it, don&acute;t. Fantastic history. Really well done. Friendly staff. Lots of options for finding out about things once you&acute;re there. We did the self-directed audio tour and it was engaging, interesting and good quality - plus it worked!!! :)\\n\\nAnother &acute;must do&acute; while in London. Hmm. Unlike other reviewers, I don&acute;t think this is the &acute;best museum&acute; in the world that I&acute;ve seen. But it is very good, very well set-out, very comfortable to spend hours wandering around - and would certainly be on the &acute;must do&acute; list while in London. An unasuming isolated building that holds a treasure of information Every display is like a chapter in a book. There is no way to tke it all in with one visit. Moving and informative and adds a human facet to the museum environment that make this museum so much more than the traditional art or natural history museums. With all of the choice each visit has the excitment of discovery. There are wonderful asian galleries, as well as the famous Elgin Marbles and Rossetta Stone. Don&acute;t foget the monumental Assyrian carving. Got totally immersed in this, fantastic puppets and actors . After a few minutes you actually forget they are puppets. Lovely theatre, you are so close to the stage but not too close. Absolutely fantastic, and I can&acute;t swim!!!\\nWell worth the cost, excellent crew, these guys know how to keep people happy. Boat trip starts off at a nice leisurely pace, until you get past Tower Bridge & then hold on to your hats as that is when the screaming starts.............whoo hoo !!!\\nExcellent attraction & the perfect way to see the sights along the river. We saw \"Shakespeare in Love\" here in March. The performance was first rate and the theater was a treat. We were able to purchase cheap tickets at the box office the day of the show and thought we might get marginal seats at best but as it turns out, our seats were amazing and really, there&acute;s not a bad seat in the house. The style of the venue is quite grand and it was a great experience to see a play in this esteemed location. Regent Street never fails to disappoint. Often decorated for the season, this bustling shopping street is lined with shoppable stores and and there is plenty of fun to be had whether you&acute;re heading to Banana Republic, the Apple store or just popping in to Hamleys for 5 floors of toys and games, you&acute;re sure to have a blast shopping on Regent Street. And after a long day of shopping, a walk through Soho and a relaxing afternoon tea or coffee are close at hand. Highgate is the crown jewel of the Magnificent Seven in my opinion. It is wonderfully interesting both historically and as a place to explore. The tour of the West cemetery is excellent and gives one a lot of history of the site as a whole plus it is the only way to view some of the more unusual aspects of the place. Do be aware that some places are off limits to photography which is unfortunate because those are the places I wanted to shoot most.\\n\\nThe East side is available to wander for as long as one wishes and it could easily be many hours in good weather. The sculptural headstones are rich with verse and information from a bygone time and the tilted, overgrown stones have such storybook character that everyone can find a strange beauty there and a connection to the past.\\n\\nI look forward to visiting again. Oh and one word of advice... wellies. It&acute;s often muddy and you&acute;ll have more fun exploring if you&acute;re prepared for it. I&acute;ve been to London many times and never had any interest in this site. What a mistake that was. This place is amazing!\\n\\nThe detail and interpretation of the site is extensive and was interesting to hear recorded accounts of working there from people who were there. The furnishings and decor really set the scene and the authentic documents and maps on the walls are very moving. More than just a well-preserved historical site allowing visitors insight into the British war effort the exhibit includes the Winston Churchill Museum. I knew little about the man before entering the exhibit and I departed wanting to know much more.\\n\\nAll in all a first rate exhibit. I highly recommend it. This bike tour was the highlight of our weekend in London. Prior to the weekend, I emailed them with a few questions and received a personal reply within minutes. That is always a good sign. The operation is efficiently and professionally run and the guides are knowledgeable and friendly. The are were comfortable and the ride easy. The amount of ground covered during the tour is really quite amazing and the time passes very quickly. Our guide, David, was interesting and entertaining and helped to make everyone in the group feel welcome. This is the best entertainment deal in London.\\n\\nMy wife and I enjoyed this tour so much that we plan to book a Fat Tire Bike Tour while in Paris next month and are now inspired to visit Barcelona and Berlin to do the tours in those locations as well. Their brochure has a place to acquire stamps from each of their locations; collect all four and they&acute;ll give you a Fat Tire Bike Tours t-shirt. Whereas this might not be the best reason for touring Europe, it&acute;s certainly a fun thing to do it you have the opportunity. The run (regsnts canal one) was informative and fun and the level was appropriate to the runners in the group. I also thought that dealing with the company was good - they were professional. My only criticism is that the booking / payments system is confusing - you have to pay before you can book which is annoying if the tour you want has been cancelled and the website has not been updated. You also don&acute;t get an email immediately confirming payment once you have paid.\\n\\nOther thna that - highly recommentded The Show is Great, Singers were great, the show was directed cleverly, the dancing Boys and Girls are so talented and energetic. It is really a tribute for Michael Jackson....it is not a Play with a Story line. Really recommended for everybody. This show is really Amazing, The Sets , The Story the Cast, everything was really Great. Music and Singing got my heart. Lots of GREEEEN Colors. This show is really recommended for everybody. very nice Musical comedy play with lots of strong words. but really worth the time and money. All the Actors were great, the music was great. A great musemn! It contains not only British artefacts but amazing &acute;stuff&acute; from around the world. From Egyptian statutes to Easter Island Maoi. From Artic canoes to Australian aboriginal artefacts with the Rosetta stone and Elgin marbles along the way. And entrance is free! But donations are requested. This area is the main postcard of London and doesn&acute;t disappoint. Big Ben, The Parliament and Westminster Abbey have each one its own enchantment. The Abbey works as a shelter for many historical persons of English history as well world history. Also is the place where are celebrated the coronation ceremonies of the British kings (or queens). Visit the Parliament is not easy, since there are restricted times for it, Complete the area the Thames River and the London Eye. Its one of those things you must do when visiting London ! Went over New Years, the weather was cold lol, but the views were unreal. In the late afternoon, not too big queues, get a great panoramic view of the city, plenty of photo opportunities !\\nWorth doing. Have visited Buckingham Palace 4 times and have seen the most wonderful displays, the Royal Wedding, Diamond Jubilee, the 60th anniversary of QE2 Coronation and this years Royal Childhood. The palace is the most beautiful I have seen, stunning State rooms, the paintings are just incredible and its a real must if visiting London in the Summer. Worth visiting the Royal Mews and Queens Gallery too. Tea in the garden is a lovely experience! This is a great show with an interesting story, very well performed, we loved it. Have seen it on Broadway too. Have seen Les Mis 3 times and just love it! My absolute favourite performance was with Alfie Boe and Matt Lucas, when Alfie sang &acute;Bring Him Home&acute; it made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up and the audience just erupted afterwards, it was electric! Apart from the function of this as a train station, where a number of lines connect this is a also a destination for Paddington Bear fans. They have a Paddington Bear shop and there is a statue of Paddington Bear. It would be good for anyone currently reading the original Paddington Bear story. Just in side the gates off Bayswater road. A nice place to sit and enjoy the sun. Interesting fountains and ponds. Sit on anencephaly seat and let the world pass by. Just another department store, and wall to wall people. Give it a miss, it&acute;s over priced and over crowded. There are better prices and service at smaller stores in the same area. An excellent way to get around London. It&acute;s not a tourist attraction but a mode of transport. At all times be aware of pick pockets. When we visited it was possible to tour the interior of the palace. The Queen was not in residence. This is not available all year. Oil on line to avoid the queues. Booking on line will save you 30 minutes of queues. But is it worth it, the interior is so crowded it lacks that sense of austerity that you get in the European cathedrals. Going up into the dome also gives you access to the exterior and an excellent view of London. A modem mix of old and new, religious iconography. It lacks the sense of history and respect that the cathedrals in Europe have. The audio guide included in the entrance fee is informative. No need to book on line. We did not experience any ques. We walked through this park on several occasions it was on the way to Buckingham palace. It was well used by all sorts, people jogging, walking, horse riding, etc. a little busy. A lot of very good art to view but the tourist crowds ruin it. Get there early to avoid the crush. When we visited part of the displays were closed due to lack of staff to man the displays. I think it was a public holiday . A very nice space for a walk, jog, picnic or just enjoy the space. Kensington palace is at one end and Hyde park at the other end. Plenty of space to stretch the legs. Great collection of art as you would expect (!) but in a really good environment. Presented simply. Fantastic building. We went to watch the Olympics in the park and the organisation was first class. The facilities were excellent. I would like to spend time wandering around the park on an ordinary day. A great show with great songs. The storyline is a little weak in places and Carole King&acute;s husband was fairly weak in the performance we saw.\\nI was taken aback by how many great songs she wrote and I had a smile on my face for much of the show.\\nIt naturally appeals to a slightly older audience who remember Tapestry but we were delighted we made the effort to see the show despite the ticket prices being top end! I first saw Mamma Mia on stage back in 2002 and it was great then...but now, I think it&acute;s even better. The theatre is a good sized venue to feel part of the action. We went for the stalls and had a good view. The theatre staff were very helpful to us as one of our group was on crutches and had difficulty with the stairs, the staff also stored the crutches for us and brought them back at the interval and at the end for us. The show is loud and colourful with far too many highlights to list, it seems to have been updated since the original show and has evolved following the movie to be more in keeping with it, but it hasn&acute;t lost any of it&acute;s original stage charm. Highly recommended and if the opportunity arose I would go again even though have already been twice! This is a great show - set in an Irish Pub you can go up on stage at the beginning of the show and intermission and buy a beer! The musicians play just like your in a pub at the beginning of the show - real atmosphere. Great story, wonderful musical performances a real treat - my 19 year old son loved it and he is going back in October to take his girlfriend for her birthday. Awwwh My son (19 years old loves Jersy Boys) so we returned having seen it in December at the Prince Edward Theatre. Still great story and performances are fabulous but I personally think it has lost something in the smaller theatre and I dont like new costumes as much - bit dull Well curated, great guide and suggestions, easy to digest, lots of comfortable seats to rest on and I like the digital tools to learn more. Free wifi on level 0 was welcomed :)\\n\\nThe BP Portraiture exhibition is not to be missed Passed through here on our way from Heathrow airport to the hotel. Served by both the Heathrow Express and Heathrow Connect trains ( as well as by many bus and tube lines ), makes this a very convenient transportation hub. There are plenty of shops inside the station - just be careful trying to navigate around the Crossrail construction outside of the station. We re-visited this small gem of a museum this past March, primarily to see the special exhibition of the Goya sketches. But we had time to see the rest of the collection. I was surprised to see 2 Gauguins on display - I presumed that they would have been on loan to the big Gauguin exhibit at the Fondation Beyeler, in Basel ( which I will not be able to see ! ). Beautifully restored, and now the terminus for the high-speed Eurostar trains to France. And to think that it was almost demolished in the 1960&acute;s. Thankfully, it escaped the fate of Penn Station, in New York. Production was excellent the casting/voices spot on and Her majesty&acute;s Theatre is easy to get to and very pleasant. We got our seats Second price stalls/royal circle seats online using lastminute.com and although they did not mention abstracted view we had to deal with a support column that was 3 rows in front of us and we could see the top of the theater (chandelier/phantom when he is up trapeze of the theater). Poor seating did not take away too much from a very fine production we still enjoy it. Not much more says London than this Tower - Worth a visit or just admire from across the street. It looks much grander in person than on any picture I seen. Many other sites to see in the vicinity. All I can say, it is good to be the King/Queen and have the world beat a path to your door вЂ“ All the masters are well represented and beautifully displayed - quite a collection. Queens Theater is Gem - very grand and quaint at the same time. What can you say about Les Mis, this is a beautiful production and the entire cast put it all out, you can tell they really enjoy their work; Truly a wonderful experience could not get the music out of my mind for two days afterwards. I was disappointed with the experience of The Shard. The views from the top are excellent, but I was expecting to be informed about the building, with pictures of the actual build, what the building houses, how high it is, etc, but I saw nothing apart from the view and the shop. Somewhere to sit and/or have a drink would have been good.\\n\\nI think a lot could be learnt from the Empire State Building (amazing!) in New York. The Shard is not worth the price, especially when there are different prices between online and on the day booking. It needs to offer more for the price. The number of items in this museum is overwhelming. I actually liked it better than the British Museum as it pertained more to European History. If you are in London and have the time, be sure to visit Greenwich! This is even more true if you are there during plesant weather! I rode the Thames shuttle boat to Greenwich on a beautiful Spring morning and could not have been more surprised by Greenwich! Walk up to the Royal Observatory and see the view of London from this great viewpoint--breathtaking! Plus how many times do you have the opportunity to stand in the eastern and western hemispheres? There is something magical about Greenwich--it is close to London, but a world away! We visited the zoo for my daughters 1st birthday. It was a cold January weekday and this meant some of the animals stayed in their cages but it was still a very enjoyable visit. It wasn&acute;t very busy so was easy to see everything. The layout is good.\\nWe particularly enjoyed the penguins and the giraffe&acute;s.\\nIt s nice seeing the old enclosures reused in different ways.\\nThe volunteers inside the rainforest were very knowledgeable and showed us things we may not have seen on our own.\\n\\nAlthough quite expensive we made use of a 2 for 1 deal and this made it more reasonable. Looks can be deceiving, we didn&acute;t eat here but if we attend a show again will likely do so. The theatre venue itself is surprisingly large and although the tiered stadium seating is a little visually off putting the seating is comfortable enough. we were on the end of a row (seating is reserved) but still had a good view of the small and intimate proscenium arch stage. The venue has a cosy bar area and is a fun place to go to see something not in the mainstream My wife surprised me with a trip to the Bull&acute;s Head on the river, a short walk from the Barnes Bridge station.\\n\\nWe arrived a few minutes early for our dinner reservation but this wasn&acute;t a problem as at this hour (7pm) the bar is where it is all happening on a Saturday evening. The dining area is a large hall with probably around ten or twelve tables of varying sizes.\\n\\nThe staff are very attentive and the menu although compact, comprises a mix of hearty meals, bar meals and chalk board specials.\\n\\nUnfortunately the beef short rib was exhausted and so we went with the poussin, the angus steak and a burger with bacon and cheese. Meals arrived in pretty short time and were of normal portion size with chips served up in small enamelware for the burger and steak. The poussin was served on a mound of couscous. Regrettably there was no garnish and had we known this we might have ordered a salad as an accompaniment. The meals were tasty nonetheless.\\n\\nA variety of beers are available on tap as well as a wine list with some good variety.\\n\\nThe dessert menu is short but sweet and the early grey chocolate fondant was very good although the pistachio ice cream seemed more like a sorbet or milk ice.\\n\\nFor those who like Jazz, the surprise is out back beyond the small courtyard where you will find live jazz daily! Prepare to be shocked, especially if you are a mormon. We went as a large group of people with a mix of hetero, homo and mono sexual people. Everyone had a good time and a good laugh. I could particularly relate because I have lived the African experience and even encountered Mormon missionaries in the US and Africa. The set was well done and the singing great.\\nHope that you don&acute;t have &acute;maggots in your scrotum&acute; ! As my title says, this is simply the best museum anywhere to visit. I defy anyone to go and not be impressed by the sheer scale and variety of the exhibits. It really is a must see. Really enjoyed our visit to the V & A but there is just so much to see, it will take another visit to see it all. There really is something for everyone and the museum has great amenities for refreshments of all kinds from a simple drink to a choice of cooked meals, well prepared sandwiches and delicious cakes to eat in pleasant surroundings. Not too expensive either which makes a pleasant change.\\nDefinitely a place for adults and children to enjoy. Some have said the tickets for this show are expensive but having visited many theatres and shows in London this is about the average. Obviously you hope that having paid this money you will see a good show and The Jersey Boys will not disappoint in any way. The stage settings, the cast, the music and the lovely theatre make this one not to be missed! If you close your eyes during the performance you could indeed be listening to Frankie and the Four Seasons. Brilliant! Take your children, take other adults, take your grannie - they will all love this place! The kid&acute;s area for finding out how things work from gases to liquids and magnets and sound, all fasinated me and I am a pensioner. The history of flight with the planes and helicopters was wonderful and you would be very hard to please if you did not find something of interest to enjoy. Also there were plenty of rest areas, the eating places were inexpensive which makes a change, and the amount of areas to keep children happy were extensive.\\nEven teenagers would be happy here (what?) with the flight simulators etc., As I said something for everyone to enjoy and much more to explore and discover the next time we return as it would be difficult to discover all it has to offer in one visit. It goes without saying that the exhibits at the da Vinci exhibition are without equal, and that the NPG pulled of a huge coup collecting so many together the excessive numbers of visitors ruined the capacity to enjoy the occasion. There was little time to stand and reflect and enjoy, disappointing in the extreme. Everything about the production was first class. The vocal and orchestral arrangements and delivery were as good as you could hear anywhere. Choreography, staging and costumes were also up there with the best. Interestin house, long lines to enter at weekends. Nice display of history and all the movies and series. Store in a museum is full of souvenirs. Nice.\\nBut the price for what you get...\\nMaybe we expected too much. Always a pleasure to visit, just wish it were easier to get tickets at short notice. My husband and myself went to this park yesterday (Sunday 2nd August) it was a lovely summers day and plenty of people milling around.\\nWe thought the park was clean and very well maintained and lots of lovely planting.\\nPlenty of things to do walking around the serpentine, hire a boat or pedalo or have something to eat/drink in the restaurant.\\nIt&acute;s amazing how quite it feels away from the hussel and bustle of the city. I&acute;ve wanted to visit for so long and finally went yesterday (Sunday) on a beautiful summers day!\\nA little tricky to find, but we weren&acute;t disappointed once we got there.. Our first view was children playing in it surrounded by family&acute;s and couples having picnics and chilling in the sun by the fountain.. Diana would of loved this!!!\\nWe thought it was very fitting to the beautiful caring person she was.\\nOk so it&acute;s not a fountain?!! But a fantastic tribute to her and loved the fact that everyone can benefit from this structure.\\nLovely on a summers day in London.. On an autumn day full of leaves?? Maybe a different story!\\nGo and visit if can totally recommend! Myself and husband booked online for Saturday 1st August for the 7.30pm show.\\nI&acute;d read the reviews before deciding to come to this comedy club in London, and we wasn&acute;t disappointed! 3 out of the 4 acts were totally brilliant!!! The last guy (Canadian) wasn&acute;t my cup of tea at all and sadly he got heckled by a group in the middle of the audience and he really verbally abused them...which was a little over the top I thought! But you can&acute;t win the all and everyone&acute;s humour is different.\\nBar drinks good prices/service and all the door staff really friendly, the whole evening nicely organised..\\nI totally recommend using the comedy store if you visit London. Definitely worth a visit, just to say you&acute;ve been there!\\nWell organised on arrival, speedy with the \"special coats\" Cocktails were good once in and service friendly!\\n40 mins is enough time as we couldn&acute;t feel our feet!\\nTotally recommend as a one off visit while in London! Amazing show would pay to see again!!! Rafiki has the most brilliant voice you must go and see this We went to see this show with our grandaughter in September. We were disappointed with the quality of the whole production. We have seen several shows in the West End and this was more like a local amateur production of which we have seen a lot better... Would definitely not recommend as not good value for money. We went to see this show recently not really knowing to expect. It is probably one of the most amusing and entertaining shows I have seen. If you are religious don&acute;t go, if you want a really fun night and are not easily offended you will love it. I haven&acute;t laughed that much for ages but not only me the whole theatre was in stitches throughout the night. If you get the chance go and see it. Bought two roamer tickets and used them to travel up and down the Thames during the day and again at night. Staff were extremely helpful on all boats Of all the parks in London, this is my favourite simply because it is cosy and not overly swamped with people. Plus it is tucked in the classy part of Mayfair. Just wonderful and perfect for summer picnics and winter walks. My husband and I had been to London many times over the years but hadn&acute;t been to see the tower. I regret leaving it so long as it is a great day out for young and old alike. The bonus was getting to see the display of poppies which were spectacular. We spent almost five hours here and doubt that we missed much. The crown jewels were fabulous to admire -even if they aren&acute;t the real thing. We were shown around by Peter the Beefeater who had a good sense of humour and made the trip interesting. The 20 towers or those that are open to the public involve a lot of spiral staircases and climbing up and down so may not be easily accessed by anyone with disabilities or health problems. My husband and I visited this aquarium on a wet day and found it very good for both adults and children. We got 2for1 vouchers which helped with the entrance fees. Awesome from start to finish. Meeting place was near the London Eye. Everyone was on time. One of the ladies had the unfortunate experience of being showered by some birds. The guide helped to clean her hair with some nappy wipes. How is that for service. The drive was good, the heavy traffic that it was, we felt safe in the driver&acute;s hands. The tour was great. I love Bath, I found it to be a special place. It was so surprisingly impressive. I think, if I go back to London, I must spend more time in Bath. I felt that those sandstone buildings, the Royal Crescent are just spectacular. The street performers were really good too, and the shops, wow. I love Stonehenge too. Truly amazing, Even though the place was crowded and took a long time to get there, it was great. Somehow, I found it peaceful. The tour guide and the driver also provided water and snacks, so it is a really good tour operator. It was not a daunting trip even though it was a full day about 10 hours as the guide entertain you with a lot of stories. Oh, the Secret place was really good too. The sceneries on the way through is really fantastic. Some of the streets are really narrow. I would recommend this trip to people who want to go outside London. This was awesome. We bought the skip the line and really, it was worth it. The feeling of just zooming past a long queu is something. Never appreciated it before, specially, when after going past what seem to be a million people queu, you still have to queu inside! But boy it is worth it. The wax works are really good and the fact that you can stand right next to them and have your photos taken is something. Have been to the one in LA and the wax figures were all barricaded, but not in London, so it was really great. Then there was this taxi ride, it was spectacular. And so was the 4d movie. Great We booked the Free Tour of Royal London and had John S as a guide. John was a superb tour guide who gave an interesting, knowledgeable and fun introduction to London even though I worked in London for several years in the past. It was as if the tour was given for the first time.\\n\\nIt was a large group but everyone was made to feel included.\\n\\nHighly recommended - we left a reasonable tip and will definitely pay for either other tours or for a personal tour guide in future with Sandemans based on the performance of John.\\n\\nWell done! Matthew is a lovely, knowledgeable guy. The bicycles were of a good quality.\\n\\nWe had booked the East End Tour and my daughter and I were looking forward to seeing the following highlighted on the tour:\\n\\nCycling by the Thames (did not do) as well as seeing and hearing the history behind the following:\\n\\nThe Wobbly Bridge (did not see)\\nShakespeare Globe (did not see)\\nRose Theatre (did not see)\\nThe Shard (only saw the top from a long distance which you can see from most of London)\\nBorough Market (did not see)\\nLondon Bridge (did not see)\\nTower Bridge (did not see)\\nSt Katherine&acute;s Dock (did not see)\\nOrnamental Canal (did not see)\\nBattle of Cable Street (did not see or discuss)\\n\\nAt lunch time we asked when we would be cycling by the Thames and were told it was too far away and would be too busy! The tour lasted exactly 2.5 hours.\\n\\nWe are at some fault in that at the beginning of the tour Matthew asked if my daughter liked animals - which she does - but at 12 years old is no longer interested in the likes of Hackney Animal Farm where we ended up! We also agreed to place ourselves in the hands of Matthew who\\nWanted to show us the canals. I like cycling by the canal but expected my daughter and I to still see and hear about the better parts of the East End. We got to see the 8th wonder of the world which was a concrete jungle and not suitable for a 12 year old who will be 13 this week. I liked the memorial of self sacrifice but again my daughter did not. I made it very clear on the booking the age of my daughter.\\n\\nHaving travelled from Japan to spend the weekend with my daughter, this was a huge disappointment that was immediately forgotten. I have previously been on a cycle tour with another tour of the East End that was far superior.\\n\\nIn future we will tell any tour guide to stick to what we had paid for. My daughter that it was brilliant - she is 12. We had excellent seats centre of 2 rows from the stage in the centre. It was great to be able to see the faces so clearly. My daughter enjoyed the performance but thought Wicked was so much better. Air con would have been appreciated! Got excellent seats in advance on the website. I have never watched anything that had such an impact on the audience. Everyone laughed the night away. Brilliant! Booked the Hidden London tour at 0900 Sunday morning and Iain was at the Underground station as promised at 1030. I was a little concerned as my travelling partner is retired and was suffering with a cough - I should not have been. Iain was extremely attentive, knowledgeable and ensured that we all were safe and well looked after.\\n\\nI presently live in Asia but previously lived in London for 7 years - Iain took us to places I had never heard of and with natural charm and enthusiam brought the history alive and relit my love of this great city. Iain is bursting with information and answered all of our questions with ease. The cycling was not at all strenuous and the route was perfect. I cannot recommend this tour enough. An absolute bargain that is worth every penny. Just two words - DO IT!',\n",
              " 'The villa itself, with marvelous gardens, ocean view is breath taking. Even this would be enough. But inside, the collection of the museum is also a must see. This is a must see for anyone who enjoys movies and movie making. Like the earlier reviews this is nothing like Universal Studios tour. This is a small group tour that stops the tram and let&acute;s you get out and walk around a working studio.\\nOur guide was Andre and I would suggest requesting him if you can. He was very knowledgable and passionate about the studio and the movies and TV shows made there and ha You have to do lots of walking. It might be great for animals to live far away from each other, but it is hard to walk with little kids such a long distance. The only food available there is junk food. I wouldn&acute;t go back there. Drive a bit longer and get to San Diego Zoo Despite varying reviews and posts about how it&acute;s illegal to hike to the sign itself and that locals don&acute;t like tourists in their neighborhood, we hiked up Mt Lee, behind the sign. It was great exercise and a fantastic view!\\n\\nWe stayed in downtown LA for work but took the subway to Hollywood/Vine subway stop then took the Beachwood Canyon Dash bus to the entrance of Hollywoodland. It&acute;s a cool community in its own right but if you walk up to the end of N Beachmont Drive there is a parking area and horse stable. You can get to the trail here. Everyone we met was both friendly and helpful with directions. There were many people out walking and hiking. Parts near the top are pretty steep, albeit paved versus the dirt trail at the beginning. Keep your eyes open for horse poop on the dirt part of the trail as it&acute;s shared with the horses. It took us about 45 each way from the trailhead. This was my second visit here. Okay... it is still funny, but I think it was not a good idea, since they did not really improve the property since the last time I have been here (cca. 7 years ago). Since my husband had never visited any of the Universal properties and I hadn&acute;t been to Universal Studios in over 20 years we decided to take the VIP tour. There were a number of other personal reasons that went into the decision, but suffice to say that I felt the cost was well worth it. One of our tour mates put it best--you&acute;re just paying for everything up-front: parking, front of the line passes (which can be used multiple times), an exceptional breakfast (come early, it&acute;s worth it!) and scrumptious lunch, not to mention guided access to intimate areas of the studio, and the ability to walk around the famous sets of the back lot.\\n\\nA note for those with larger vehicles--we were driving our truck and cargo trailer on this trip which meant that we were going to be unable to take advantage of valet parking. The reservations office was kind enough to arrange a &acute;drive on.&acute; Not exactly sure what that meant, we arrived early and went to the guard gate as directed. The guard gave us a special parking pass and directed us to speak with the attendant at the preferred parking area. We were then directed to another lot where the tour buses pick up their passengers which was DIRECTLY in front of the entrance. I&acute;ve walked further to cross the parking lot to get into my local grocery store! This was a MAJOR plus for us since my husband has some mobility issues (a primary reason we picked the VIP tour in the first place.)\\n\\nAs for visiting the park itself, it was horrendously crowded for a mid-week summer day and I was a bit disappointed with the rides, but since we didn&acute;t have to wait in line I wasn&acute;t as disappointed as if I had waited an hour for a 2-3 minute &acute;experience.&acute; It seemed to me that Universal doesn&acute;t implement the concept of an amusement ride as well as they USED to implement their show experiences--which have mostly been replaced by rides. I always thought of Universal Studios as a place to get a glimpse into the magic of the movies--not a place for roller coasters or simulation rides. In my opinion, the other Southern California parks are a better choice if rides are your focus.\\n\\nHonestly, I&acute;m not sure I&acute;ll be back to the Universal unless I take the VIP tour again--the added value from the tour experience is worth the money, the park itself was not. We are not a big amusement park family, but were excited to get a glimpse into the movie world at Universal Studios. We splurged on Front of the Line passes because we had limited time to visit and we were visiting during Spring Break - it was definitely worth it! Absolutely do the studio tour when you first arrive, it gives you a great orientation and is very interesting. The kids really enjoyed the Animal show. The special effects show was quite educational albeit cheesy. The Simpson ride gives you a serious roller coaster feel, so you may either love it or scream through it. The Shrek show/movie was very cute. The scariest part about the House of Horrors was that there are live actors jumping out to scare you. Tip-general parking is $15/day and valet parking is $30 (but you get to park right next to the entrance to the park). If you are limited for time, I would recommend valet parking. Being on a very short 2 day first-time visit, this tour provided me with a good overview of Hollywood, Beverly Hills, Bel Air and Universal Studios. My only negative points were that the title is misleading as the tour did not show all LA, i.e. Downtown, and it could have routed through Beverly Hills shopping area which I saw later. To include these, the time at Universal Studios could be made slightly shorter If you&acute;re in Hollywood - might as well be here and tick if off your list coz its unlikely you&acute;re ever coming back. The street is crowded with tourists and after you&acute;ve 5 signs, you&acute;ve seen em all. The studio is pretty good. The rides are thrilling - Transformers is the best.\\nBuy the fast access pass to cut the queues - its worth it. And plan to spend the whole day here. Loads of different entertainment for all age groups. You have to go to the Griffith if you&acute;re in LA but parking can be nightmare if you go at a peak hour like sunset...why would you go for views in the middle of the hot LA sun anyways!!!\\nWe had to walk over a mile and half from the street side where we parked before hiking uphill to get here...but once you get here...the views are fantastic - great photo opps at sunset. Must visit Great place if you&acute;re an art lover. The grounds are beautifully maintained. The ladies giving the tours are passionate. And more importantly you dont pay a cent to get in.\\nBut, its a great place to visit if you&acute;re an art lover. For a regular tourist, you might get bored after a couple of hours. You definitely need at least a half day to view all the exhibitions and a full day if you intend on searching for the artists signature on piece of art. With the exception of a few attractions, all you see here are animated 3D attractions. Do not miss the lot tour, which has been upgraded with the addition of Fast and the Furious.\\n\\nThe Waterworld show was also worth the price of admission, just show up early and get a seat.\\n\\nSpend extra time to walk through Universal Walk, which comes alive at night.',\n",
              " 'We had a leisurely walk through the Botanical Gardens, which were absolutely beautiful. It was a lovely day and people were sunning themselves on the long stretch of grass overlooking the river. There were beautiful bridges to get a closer look at the views over the water with the ducks swimming around. A delightful visit. You step off the train and walk out to this amazing view of Lake Lucerne, the Alps, a beautiful old town with amazing architecture and bridges that are so inviting. Views are amazing and the 1 hour boat ride is so much fun let a lone the cable car on the way down!! Rigi is super easy to reach from Lucern and central Switzerland. I bought the Tell Pass which allows several train, cablecar, and free transportation along Central Swizterland (see the train office desk at Lucern train station). Because Rigi is not high as Titlis and Pilatus there are a lot of greenery pine trees, pockets with some forests and lots of walking paths. One can do several tours and ride along different trains and cable cars. The route to Pilatus is an amazing throwback riding the super old but well preserved train.\\nI rode the train on a sunny June day so the weather was nice and pleasant. From the summit there are several trails to do, I did the flower trail with breathtaking views. I bought the Tell Pass which allows several train, cablecar, and free transportation along Central Swizterland (see the train office desk at Lucern train station). In general, the Swiss trains and stations are the best. Clean trains and on time all the time. Athough they are the most expensive as well. Nice place to have some peace time and acknowledge the monument for what it is but sometimes hard to do this when there are plenty of tourists posing for pictures with impropriety The city of Lucern is, really busy and the Chapel Bridge is a testament to this. Plenty of people walking across the bridge, you simply can not stop to look at the pictures. And the flower baskets that was supposed to line the outside were missing. I was there April 16-19, didn&acute;t see the flowers. Oh well, maybe next time. I enjoyed Lucerne, nevertheless We were there in April this year and there was still plenty of snow. This is one place I will be coming back to one day to explore the hiking. The footpaths in this place is amazingly clean and just well kept really. The view is SPECTACULAR. Beautiful Mt Rigi. It was nice to stay in Lucern and the lake was a great place to walk around, the busy city Lucern is.',\n",
              " 'Great football stadium. Easy to get to by metro. Good crowd. And very impressive & efficient entry and exit of almost 100k people.\\n\\nPlus we were lucky enough to see &acute;El Derbi Madrilenos&acute;! :) Atletico won 0-1. My favourite museum of the &acute;big 3&acute;. Relaxed, well-presented, nice place to walk around with a pleasant internal courtyard garden.\\n\\nGuernica made a huge impact. It is a magnificent piece of work, presented very well. Stunning building adjacent to the Royal Palace. Walked in during a festival mass, which I felt a little awkward with as the congregation seemed a little put out with a steady stream of tourists milling by. Stumbled on this having done all our research on buildings, museums etc, prior to our visit.\\n\\nIt&acute;s a short walk outside Plaza Mayor.\\n\\nIt&acute;s quite literally Spain in a box ;\\n\\nLots of seated and standing stalls, selling many and varied tapas, pastries, beautiful wines, chocolates, hams ....\\n\\nThe vendors are great, very patient when attempting our best Spanglish ordering food and drink with no hint of arrogance making us feel very welcome. Suppose that&acute;s the essence of sales in any country ?\\n\\nSeriously worth a visit whilst in Madrid. the atmosfere was great, beautiful maintained. The waterdams are Nice, and a lot of musicians playing Music along the water. Enough Places to sit and take a drink. We raced across Madrid to get to the Basilica before it closed and we were so pleased that we did, it is an incredible place. One of the most beautiful churches or cathedrals that we have seen anywhere in the world. Great welcome from the lovely man on the desk and wonderful music playing inside too. It moved me to tears with the beauty of it all. Great use of space inside and out, various displays. Good shop reasonably priced items. Best of all are the views from the top floor across the city, you need to buy a ticket for the terrace first but worth it. This is an absolute must see when in Madrid. The paintings are amazing, so many rooms to visit, it&acute;s great value. The restaurant is excellent too, good gift shops and visitors facilities. Highly recommended. This was the one place I really wanted to visit during our trip to Madrid and was so disappointed that it was closed on the day we wanted to visit. We checked the website and there was no mention of the closure and the information we had said that it opened everyday. It was a was a public holiday with a parade of military, the King was in attendance and so was resident at the palace. It is an amazing palace to view from outside and we were able to visit the gardens and see the guards on foot and horseback. We also were in the right place to see the King and his entourage drive past! We happened upon this free walking tour of Spain while meandering through Plaza Mayor. We learned a lot about Spanish history and customs. They do spend a bit of time plugging their \"pay\" tours - which is to be expected. I highly recommend this tour. If you&acute;d like to see the \"changing of the guard\" be sure to plan your visit to the Palacio Real on a Wednesday. I&acute;d been looking forward to seeing Plaza Mayor only to be disappointed by the annoying things aimed at tourists. There were people dressed as Mickey and Minnie Mouse...I know! Random! Other people dressed up in other ways. This wasn&acute;t the annoying part. What was annoying was the squeaky voice box they put in their mouth to attract attention. There was no way I could enjoy a leisurely lunch at an outdoor cafe with that craziness going on.\\n\\nThe Plaza itself was lovely. I recommend seeing it very early in the morning as even late at night the annoying squeaking people trying to bilk tourists for money. If you&acute;re a fan of Modern Art, this is a museum you&acute;ll want to see. I enjoyed the free hours that gave me enough time to see the art I wanted to see. Our first visit during the free hours (2 hours almost every night) we were able to see the works of art that were \"must-see\" for us. (They have a fantastic guide to help you find them all.) Our second night we strolled around and discovered some amazing new art.\\n\\nHaving been at the Vatican Museum earlier this year, I couldn&acute;t help but compare the two. I MUCH prefer the Prado. It seems much better organized and more pleasing. Also there are far fewer patrons at the Prado than at the Vatican Museum. It was a much nicer place to visit. We received discount coupons (20 Euros per person in lieu of 30 Euro per person) for a performance after our walking tour of Madrid. The show was very good and enjoyable. I&acute;ve never been to a flamenco show before, so I&acute;ve nothing to compare this show to...but I thought it was great.\\n\\nThe food, however...was pricey! 6 Euro for a bottle of water? Good thing the drink was included with our discount coupon.\\n\\nIf you can get the discount coupon, it&acute;s a good deal. Expect to be crammed into a small room with a hundred of your closest friendsвЂ¦ the service is awfulвЂ”god forbid that you want a second drinkвЂ¦ BUT, the show is well worth the money! I donвЂ™t know much about flamenco, but we really enjoyed it. The woman dancer was particularly good! Was not open during posted open times. Several people in front were all very confused. We all waited around for awhile to see if it might open, but nothing happened. Everyone walked away confused. ItвЂ™s hugeвЂ”but really not worth more than a walk through. There are plenty of cafes around the square but they all appear to be tourist traps. We sat at one and were treated like cattleвЂ”but the people watching is pretty good. Walk through to see it, but then go a block off the Plaza for a drink. If you speak Spanish and youвЂ™re REALLY into religious art, then MAYBE youвЂ™d enjoy this tour.\\n\\nI thought the reliquary would be worth the wait through the restвЂ¦ but oh myвЂ¦ it is excruciating and LONG! Before getting to the really quite impressive and interesting reliquary and pretty church, you have to stand for well over an hour listening to a lecture ask you walk through a few rooms of art. If there was any way to leave the tour and escape, we would have!\\n\\nIf youвЂ™re brave enough to goвЂ¦ go early and get a free timed ticket. This may seem touristy or a bit like an American mall, but the vendors that are selling food there are out of this world. It was fun, to go experiments, taste and savor all types of Tapas. The Spanish cheese and olives melted in your mouth. A must for purchase where the razor clams. The crowds were fun and festive. We went on a rainy day, but it worth a stop as some of the greatest works are there. The building is massive and the architecture impressive. A foodie&acute;s delight!\\n\\nCome early, stay late, and enjoy the vast assortment of tapas and seafood that Madrid has to offer. Indulge in freshly shucked oysters, try the salt cod baccalao, and munch on the many colorful assortment of tapas available at this market turned food haven. Don&acute;t miss the anchovies and olives, and make sure to wash everything down with either champagne or the local Vermuth de Grifo, loosely transalted Vermuth on tap.\\n\\nDon&acute;t get too carried away...the prices will add up!',\n",
              " 'I liked the idea of discovering the CBD & the tourism areas in Melbourne with a commentary on board. It is a very nice way to discover the city or see it from another view. I would recommend for any visitor to Melbourne. I am not an \"art lover\" as such but gee those people are clever!!\\nThe detail is minute and a few of the paintings are a few meters square so how they got their perspective is amazing.\\nA fantastic experience. As the title suggests it is a big (and long) day out!

              " 'Overall worth the visit with something for everyone to enjoy especially the shark education show at the amphitheater. The staff were very friendly and all appeared to love what they do. We hadn&acute;t been to the aquarium in years but made it destination on this trip and we were not disappointed. We&acute;re members of the aquarium which made our \"member access\" very easy each day we visited. We love going early before it starts to fill up with various tour groups and children&acute;s field trip visits. it&acute;s a feast for the eyes and a wonder to visit all over again. The bay is absolutely gorgeous. You can walk around it; there are good fish restaurants all around--try grilled sandabs. Also check out the Cannery shopping center; not many shops, but some decent deals on casual clothing. They have a great selection of everything plus interactive exhibits and fun discovery things for kids. Monterrey Bay Aquarium breaks down into 2 main sections, plus a few side attractions. I recommend spending 3 to 4 hours, at least. That way you get your money&acute;s worth this place is not cheap, but also take in all the truly awesome displays on offer.\\n\\nBreak your tour in half with a snack break in the middle, the food at their cafe and restaurant is very good. And be sure to catch at least one show, a feeding or a talk with naturalist staff and sea life. Also check the schedule at the auditorium and pick one or two movies/videos to watch, it is a chance to sit down between lots of walking.\\n\\nIf you have kids with you start with the kids side with lots of interactive displays, touching pools and fun activities. If you&acute;re an all grown-ups group, head straight for the deep sea and jellies displays, and be sure to really take in the various artist generated ecological displays too.\\n\\nBe sure to walk outside onto the ocean side deck for air a few times during your tour, the underwater displays and lighting can make you queasy, go outside and breath a few times, then go back in and finish! A fun place to shop during the day and interesting location as the sun starts to set. The restaurant owners are pushing to get customers inside by providing free samples of clam chowder. This is a great idea if it&acute;s what you want to eat, so you can find the restaurant that makes it to your taste. Otherwise, it&acute;s kinda like the old carnival barkers rounding up customers. Most of the restaurants are basic seafood, take your pick...there are lots of them here. A number of the locations have a happy hour but beware it&acute;s usually a particular type of drink (margarita or cheap wine). They usually have prices on a board outside the restaurant, check for the prices and limitations. A great place to spend the day shopping and people watching.\\nThere are so many restaurants to choose from here, from breakfast/lunch bistros to full dinner sit-downs. Take the time to walk through all the shops and around the monuments, there are so many photo opportunities. A must see location when in Monterey. Nice old church. I like how they are preserving the look and feel of the old. There are pockets in hte interior wasll where you can see the old church Well worth the price of admission. The adults and children all enjoyed their time there. It is a world-class facility. Displays are well organized, and we learned a lot. The children applied what they learned when we visited the ocean.',\n",
              " 'In this area of the city you feel you are in France with lovely restaurants, street artists and entertainers and wide boulevards. In narrow streets you find hidden areas with craft stalls, and lovely patisseries! If you spend any time in Montreal, do go on a trip on the River on an AML tour. We took the two day tour which included Whale-watching, stopping over at in Quebec City and in Chateau Richlieu, a hundred miles further north. We had to be up early as boarding started at 6am. Luggage was easily checked in and loaded on board by the crew. Breakfast was on board. There was a good choice and it was delicious. The beginning of the journey is through a flat, rather industrial area, but there are some pretty waterside villages later. We were fortunate with the weather, and with the number of passengers on board. There were only 150 on board at first, and 50 on the second day so we had first class service from the staff. We can&acute;t praise them enough. They are proud of their service and so enthusiastic. We had a running commentary, entertainment during lunch, and really enjoyed talking to the crew members who were never too busy to talk to us. There were all nationalities on board, but French and English was used to inform us of where we should look! One member of the dining room staff provided massages for those interested! Lessons in navigation were provided by the entertainer. The Guide had excellent knowledge of the area and really worked hard to make sure we all gained as much from the trip as possible. Meals were really lovely and we enjoyed talking to a couple from Montreal who left the boat at Quebec City, where we docked at 5pm. An evening meal (buffet) and night&acute;s stay was provided at the famous Fairmont hotel, that stands so proudly on the rocks and is the most photographed hotel in Canada! Next day the boat sped to the wider part of the river where sea water took over, and on to find the Whales which are traced by radar. We didn&acute;t imagine it would be so exciting. All the crew came out to watch too, and they created a great atmosphere. We saw Minky Whales with their smooth white bellies looking like huge white waves. We were close to Hump-backed Whales but there were no spectacular tail lifts for us. After a while we were taken up a fjord, where the captain showed his skill by parking us close to a waterfall- close enough to fill his cup with water! After a night&acute;s sleep in another five-star Fairmont Hotel, we went by bus back to Quebec City, stopping at a dairy, a duck farm and an old watermill on the way. These were charming, trying to promote local produce, but we wondered if they were worth stopping to visit. Quebec City is so vibrant and interesting, that personally we would have preferred to go straight there. Again, we had good weather, so it was pleasant to wander outside, but may not be so good on wet days. The AML Agent, Guy, had to stay behind to look after a lady who had been taken ill overnight but they all returned to Quebec City by train later. It was good to feel under the care of this company. AML Montreal did a splendid job. We wish them well. Fui a Vieux Montreal a noite e de dia. ГЂ noite Г© lindamente iluminada e muito segura (como toda Montreal). Existem diversas opГ§Гµes de bares e restaurantes para se divertir.\\nDe dia, se pode apreciar mais o conjunto arquitetonico do local. Aproveite para andar sem pressa e observar o rio e as pontes. Dentro do Biodome encontramos diversos ecossitemas indo da Floresta Tropical Г\\xa0 Antartica. Nestes ecossitemas encontramos vegetaГ§ГЈo, ГЎgua e animais (a maioria de pequeno porte). Г‰ passeio Гіtimo para compreender o meio ambiente, melhor do ir ao zoologico pois vemos a interaГ§ГЈo do habitat com os animais. Este local Г© onde ocorrem eventos e shows em Montreal. No momento que visitei nГЈo estava havendo nenhum evento especial. Vale para um passeio rГЎpido para ver as construГ§Гµes e as bonitas fontes de ГЎgua.\\nEm frente da Place des Arts hГЎ shopping para quem quiser comer alguma coisa ou fazer umas comprinhas. O oratГіrio Г© visita essencial para se fazer em Montreal. A arquitetura Г© muito bonita e ele Г© composto de diversos andares.

Muito bonito.\\nPara quem tem problema de locomoГ§ГЈo Г© disponibilizado um micro-Гґnibus prГіximo ao portГЈo de entrada que faz a subida atГ© o OratГіrio.

Visited this place today and was very disappointed. The bar tender was very unhelpful and did not appear interested in serving us at all. He was unable or unwilling to answer even basic questions about the menu. When asked if the Irish Stew dish came with vegetables his reply was \"of course its stew isnt it\". When asked what the Curry of the day was we were told it was just curry, even the chef or manager wouldnt know what sort it was! We decided to leave and didnt eat here, extremely disappointed with this Irish pub, the only unwelcoming Irish pub I have ever visited.',\n",
              " 'Moscow Metro is a masterpiece. Some stations, especially the older ones are trully artwork! If you need to get from A to B, then this would be the fastest way to go. Traffic jams are horrible in the city. I don&acute;t recommend to go there in times when people getting to or off work if you just want to enjoy the view. Is the biggest ortodox church of Moscow and recently rebuilt after have been destroyed by Stalin. So, seems old in style, but is quite new. Is impressive for the size and the five golden domes. No pictures inside. The Armoury opens 4 times a day for visits of one and a half hour. There&acute;s an audioguide for one hour. The collection is so vast that you leave with the sensation that you barely saw 10 % of it. Probably never you&acute;ll see such amount of gold, silver and precious stones reunited in a single place. Also are precious clothes, religious artifacts, chariots, weapons and many artistic objects. Among it I must to mention a collection of FabergГ© eggs with about 10 of it. It&acute;s a must when you visit Moscow. Tickets are sold inside it, not in the ticket windows of Kremlin. Very nice street for shopping souvenirs, seat in a restaurant, just a stroll or enjoy the performances that many artists present along the street everyday. Really pleasant. Very interesting to know the history of one of the most famous theatres and visit its venues. But to visit it, if you don&acute;t speak Russian there are only two options: Monday and Friday, at 12:30 pm. Groups of 15-20 at maximum, can visit in a guided tour. Russian speakers have those times and also on Wednesdays. Arrive early, because always there are more interested then the permitted number of visitors. Yes, there are some paintings of the great masters like Rembrandt. All the rest is fake. Tons of plaster casts including some of the greatest masterpieces of the world. Probably is useful to teach the Russian children about art, but you don&acute;t go to St. petersburg to see replicas of Michelangelo&acute;s David of Venus of Milo and this is what you will se there, basicaly. Staff doesn&acute;t speak English and doesn&acute;t care about provide any service for the visitors. Go there only if you have nothing else to do and it&acute;s raining. Ok, there&acute;s some Rembrandts... The Kremlin is impressive, of course. Inside it are five cathedrals which are more beautiful outside then inside it. No pictures are allowed inside the churches. There&acute;s also the Tsar&acute;s Bell (the biggest of the world, which was never used) and the Tsar&acute;s Canon which is also the biggest and never used. There are also other point of less interest. In summary, the best of Kremlin are its walls and towers. Absolutely fantastic and probably you will never see something like those things that you see there. There are no many places in the world with such amount of precious stones and giant nuggets of gold and platinum. Located inside the Kremlin, tickets are sold inside (not at the ticket windows of Kremlin) and security is very restrict. You can not enter with cameras of even cell phones. Impossible not be impressed by the huge walls of Kremlin the beautiful building of GUM, specially if you know what that place means for world&acute;s history. Is the heart of Moscow. It&acute;s a landmark that every visitor must see and take a picture in front of it. But don&acute;t waste your time or money going inside. Nothing special to see there. We travelled by Sapsan from Moscow to St Petersburg on 28 October. Its a great experience -service very slick and well organised. Punctual with easy check in. Would recommend. This was a real surprise to me - I was expecting a few buildings within a walled compound - but it was a beautiful setting with lovely gardens & churches with an interesting wall and watchtowers steeped in history Absolutely gorgeous building in a beautiful setting on red square - no queues on the day we visited but it was -3c outside!',\n",
              " 'As a BMW fan it was definitely fun for me and even my 3 years old daughter enjoyed it and made through the factory tour (robots were fun).\\n\\nBMW Welt entry us free of charge, parking is max. 10EUR, factory tour was 16EUR for us three. You can see latests BMW car & motorcycle models there and play along some interactive games - occupied by kids heavily :)\\n\\nBMW Museum entry is not free, but definitely worth it as you go through complete history of car & motorcycle making learning a lot about it if you wish.\\n\\nFood is available on the premises, but quite expensive.\\n\\nLockers are free of charge and do use them if you go to factory tour as it is forbbiden to take photos anyway.... I&acute;ve been to Munich loads of times but this time was my favourite because I saw it on a bike. I saw more in a shorter amount of time and I also got good back stories to a lot of the tourist attractions. We had Tony as our guide and he took us through history, to a beer garden and made us laugh and feel comfortable. The group was a bit large (around 20 people) and would have preferred a smaller intimate group but it was ok. We had a lot of fun, the weather was great and it was definitely value for our money. The .pagodas from different Asian countries, were quite spectacular (if small), but they make up a very small proportion of this park which is not close to the rest of the attractions in Munich. If you have limited time in Munich, I would not go out of your way to visit Westpark. It is a lovely oasis for locals, but my wife and I (who were locals at the time) were disappointed. if you like cars, go, if people in your party do not like cars, they can enjoy a stroll through Olympiapark, and you can enjoy the museum. The history is good, the old cars are just beautiful. The Rolls Royce collection / room is quite small but worth the trip up the escalator! The glytothek was a beautiful building filled with precious and pristine Greek artifacts. During WWII it was all but destroyed and much of the collection was badly damaged. Photographs and paintings in each room serve as reminders that art too can be a casualty of war. What is remaining is stunning, especially the room of Gods and Faun room.\\n\\nPerfect for a rainy day, near the city center, and the cafe is very popular. Only 1в‚¬ on Sundays! The park is huge, much larger than NYC Central Park.\\n\\n- Public & private stables with horse paths throughout.\\n- Off-leash dog friendly.\\n- Borders the nightly Isar with a bunch of smaller streams running throughout.\\n- Several larger &acute;lakes&acute; with a lot of water fowl.\\n- Has a natural permanent wave in the southern part that attracts local and internal surfers year round.\\n- Northern part is much more wild/natural (you can get lost, no traffic noise, very natural) than southern part, which contains more manicured gardens & lawns, fountains.\\n- Contains 4+ biergartens to break the long walks. This is my favorite building to photograph on the Rhine River. It is so distinctive. The white of the building stands out distinctly in the river with the beautiful background. It seems that this place can be overlooked because it is a bit out of the main area of town. The grounds are the BEST. We easily spent three hours here. The rooms go on forever. The dГ©cor is quite varied and gave a very good experience with the audio guide. The platz exceeded expectations. It is so pleasant to be here. The people are friendly and it feels safe and welcoming. Lovely inside and great views on the top. Although it is a lot of steps to get there but it is worth it. My only regret in my Europe holiday is, I should have not brought that much stuff with me and I should have had Munich for my ffirst stop and do some shopping there as it is dirt cheap here even in Marienplatz. On the cosmetics are a steal. Marienplatz is very central. Lots of little shops and some same old buildings. Good place and eating is really dirt cheap compared to other parts of Europe. Oh there was a pizza place in Marienplatz that has the most beautiful pizza and boy, they serve it large. Marienplatz is okay to walk around and shop around.',\n",
              " 'Once you enter, you just can&acute;t get the songs out of your head. Loved every minute...I went alone and it took me roughly 45 minutes to look at things....they honor a AAA discount too! It was well worth the visit and there were nice activities for kids so they had to do something. Everything country related is here for you to see! Even the Elvis \"King\" Presley&acute;s car!\\n\\nTIP: Do buy tickets online and pick them up at info counter (if you can not print them) and skip the looong line! Well being in Nashville, Ryman is a must even though ticket price of $20/adult is in my opinion a bit over the edge.\\n\\nYou will get the feeling of the past standing there and I can only imagine how great it must be to listen to a live event in here!\\n\\nYou can even record your own CD if you have the skills (extra charge)! Interesting with plenty of information boards around. Make sure to catch the free 20 min show by Anthony King if you can. The GOO is an enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours of an evening. The quality of the artists is very high - and a big range of music types and styles are performed. Arrive at least an hour early to get parking (or take the GOO shuttle) and leave during the last set to avoid major traffic jam exiting the property. While food and alcohol are available at concessions, the food is pretty wretched - plan to eat early or head out to a club after for food and music. We stopped by the Parthenon after being told about it on one of our day tours and only seeing it in the distance. It costs $6 for adults and $4 for 17 and under. I would recommend it as it has a lot of interesting museum pieces in the basement (you enter in the basement entrance) and then the statue inside the main building is very impressive. The giant bronze doors are amazing in that with a gentle push you can easily move them.\\n\\nLots of free parking right beside it and there is a small gift shop in the basement. I went to the museum to humor my wife who is the country music fan in the family and ended up being quite impressed with it. There is a lot of interesting things to look at besides 1000 guitars, like Elvis&acute;s gold car and gold piano or some other vehicles.\\n\\nI was really impressed with the building and the layout as they have you go into an elevator to start at the third floor and then when you go down to the next floor, it has you go out into a huge atrium.\\n\\nDefinitely worth a visit. Huge gift shops as well. I am not a country music fan but I was very impressed with the Ryman Auditorium. We did the self guided tour which has you walk around the top of the auditorium and looking at several displays then back down to the stage area and along the back where there is more displays. For $10, you can get a picture on the stage itself through a photographer they have set up there.\\n\\nThere is a very good gift shop that my wife spent way too much money at. Took the entire family of 5 on the showboat dinner cruise and I felt while overall a good experience, it was probably not worth the $500 it would have cost me if I hadn&acute;t used my British Airways points to book it. The boat itself is very nice with the only complaint being extremely small bathroom facilities. The crew was very friendly and helpful.\\n\\nUpon getting on the boat, you are somewhat rushed into starting dinner right at 7 as immediately told that the buffet closes at 7:45. It was ok though as after you ate, you could spend until 8:15 upon when dessert arrived or until 9 pm when the show starts to look around the boat and enjoy the leisurely ramble up the river.\\n\\nI was disappointed by the food as it was average quality, your typical buffet style with the usual chicken and roast beef as the meat. The show made up for it somewhat as it was pretty high energy set of songs that took 1 hr 15 minutes and even though we were stuck at the back side on the main floor, it was entertaining. I think the people on the balconies that ringed the main floor had the best view. I saw only part of the stage. The plantation was an interesting visit as you were able to go on a lengthy 40 minute tour of the house and learn its history and then walk around the grounds. The tour guide was very knowledgeable\\n\\nIf your interested, there is also a winery and wine tasting onsite. I stopped here with the family and spent over two enjoyable hours. We went to the main house first and went through the tour which was very interesting and well done. It was a bit disappointing to have to look through each room&acute;s door blocked in glass to see the exhibit but ok. The guide was informative and she tried to make it interesting.\\n\\nWe very much enjoyed the walk around the beautiful flower garden where the president and his wife are buried and then the longer walk down to original cabin, even taking the longer walk along the creek and to the back fields. Worth the walk for sure. This trio provided an entertaining 1.5 hours on tour bus. The \"tour\" part was very limited and I had hoped for more. Most of the humor was very funny but some did fall flat. It was obvious they paid close attention to the info provided at the time the tickets were purchased as they tailored their music to that info, such as songs that mention a geographical area. The male singer was described as an up and coming Nashville star and he was very good, as were the two women. Interesting, unique, and fun time. enjoyed the visit. I did find the layout of the museum confusing, and the maps not particularly helpful particularly when trying to find something specific. Nice exhibits and lots to see. There is so much history packed into this park, I am always learning something new everytime I take family and friends there. Great photo-ops and when you get hungry Germantown or the Farmers Market are right there! They didn&acute;t have much for sale on display in a very small retail space with many people packed into it to the point of claustrophobia. The t-shirts were terribly expensive past reason. The building it is located in is very interesting though to walk through with the exposed beams and wood floors with lots of history. The other shops, galleries and boutiques in the area made up for what the pickers fell short on.',\n",
              " 'liked - interesting and some good interactive displays\\nDisliked - having to go between buildings film was OK but a bit too sentimental rather than factual. Our hotel booked us a cab and we didn&acute;t really know which restaurant we were heading for. The rain was torrential and it was all we could do to run into the cab at the hotel and out at the other end. We happened to run into Snug Harbor. There was a short queue and the shows had sold out so we opted to simply go for dinner, As there was a 45 minutes wait we took a seat in the bar area amidst water dripping onto the window tables and got chatting to some visiting people.\\nOur table was called almost an hour later and we were seated in a window table in the restaurant area - fortunately dry. We didn&acute;t really hear any music or jazz but anything would have done on such an awful night.\\nThe Pinot Grigio by the glass was fine and we both ordered burgers. They were tasty and the accompanying baked potato topped with sour cream and chives was good.\\nTo be honest, we could have been in any restaurant of its type in New Orleans but on such a night Snug Harbor fitted the bill and wasn&acute;t expensive for OK food. I had booked the Natchez Steamboat cruise several weeks in advance - advice is don&acute;t as it is totally weather dependent and probably good if the weather is fine but a waste of time and money if it is not. We hit the remnants of a tropical storm and the Sunday brunch cruise was a write off in terms of enjoyment. Fortunately we didn&acute;t go for the brunch element which looked unappetising and I saw the galley preparing the food that didn&acute;t inspire me. We were fortunate in that we got a corner table in the Texas Bar on the top deck and sat therefor the two hours with drinks - the Captain&acute;s bar on the lower deck had air conditioning which made it cold and uninviting.\\nThe rain came down and hid any thoughts of a view and the poor people sat on the outside decks were drenched. The saving grace was a group of guides who didn&acute;t care about the rain and provided some welcome entertainment as they were polite and chatty and laughed a lot even though they were soaking wet!\\nAs we were in new Orleans, we had to do the Mississippi river cruise but I would advise leaving it until the day to make a booking and pray for good weather. It isn&acute;t a cheap attraction but worth the cost as it is amazing. There is so much to see that you need a few hours so arriving at 4 pm wasn&acute;t good as it closes at 5. The layout is such that you walk along a path and get to see so much. Great for kids and teenagers, ours really enjoyed it. After several visits to NOLA, went here and were very surprised. Built around 2008, it was a clean covered market area, with some permanent restaurants and booths and then plenty of smaller ones as it was a Sunday morning. Something for everyone and a lot of fun. This is just an eclectic bar with a nice choice of drinks and as far as we noticed, doesnt serve any food. We were only here for the music. Its worth noting from the time table on the door who is playing and dates and times. We watched an awesome blues and jazz singer who did many Billie Holiday songs, backed by a very talented band. So professional. This venue also has a few \"noisy\" groups such as a loud brass band of rappers which followed and we didnt enjoy, but it was so easy to move on and find another venue. Its worth the slightly longer trek past the mayhem thats Bourbon St. However, I can recommend the Frenchman St musical joints. You will find something you like Bourbon St is everything young enthusiastic revellers want. Loud, noisy vibey and great for a pm to am party place. Its ot for all though, there are the folks who are looking for jazz and blues bands in venues where one can still hold a conversation and enjoy a pleasant evening. Most of the French Quarter is absolute mayhem after dark. If this is not for you, dont despair - catch a bicycle cab to Frenchman St,which is out of the Quarter. Old style jazz clubs, Oompah brass, eclectic stuff can all be found here, almost like a NOLA from yesterday. Some tend to up the tempo after 11 pm, others simply work from sundown to 10 ish then close for the day. Judy was a fantastic guide and made the tour fun, informative and interesting. She was so knowledgeable, full of local stories and really good fun. She also interacted so well with us and the time passed so quickly. Highly recommended. If you are tied of Bourbon Street and want to hear good Jazz than this is the place to visit. Much more lower key but more unique in its own right. If you are into Jazz, than this is the place to come. A great little museum in the French Quarter. On two levels covering medicines going back over 200 years. Only $5 administration and well worth a visit. It seems that they were in middle of a major move and expansion. We stopped by on a recent visit and the clerk basically told us that the entire beverage exhibition is now closed. He indicated that their new location will be really great and a totally transformed exhibit... but he didn&acute;t try too hard to sell us on seeing what remained. The move and reimagination timeframe was not very clear. As others have noted, it&acute;s a little off the beaten path. Likely not worth seeking out until they reopen in a new location. As so many others have said, it is a far better experience than I expected. Plan on spending the entire day, if you want to see it all. It would be too much at half the price. Save your money and time for a carriage ride around the quarter or a really good meal.',\n",
              " 'We did the tour of the entire Rockefeller Centre as well as visited the Top of the Rock. Both were well worth it and very enjoyable.\\n\\nKim, our tour guide, is a 38 year resident of NY. He is erudite, funny, generous and knowledgeable. We could have walked around the place ourselves, but we wouldn&acute;t have known anything about what we were seeing or the history and features of each sight. It was really worthwhile.\\n\\nAll other staff were polite and efficient also.\\n\\nThe view from the top was good bu, after having seen the Empire State Building, not unexpected. We had Murray as tour guide, a native New &acute;Yawker&acute;, for the &acute;Where it all began&acute; tour from City Hall to Battery Point. It was terrific. It was informative, educational, entertaining and interesting. We appreciated Murray&acute;s knowledge of, and passion for, his city and other interests.\\n\\nAnd, yes, Murray - if you&acute;re reading this - we had heard of Alexander Hamilton before as, in preparation for our holiday, we had watched the excellent documentary series on New York (made for PBS) which included an episode on him. I agree that he is one of the unsung heroes not only of the US, but of many of the systems we take for granted today such as prudential regulations.\\n\\nMy only suggestion is that on really hot days - as it was - the group try to stop in the shade a little more often. We came to Ellis Island with a fairly good knowledge and understanding of the issues, and left it very impressed.\\n\\nWe started by seeing the short film which was a great introduction, and by taking the self-paced audio tour which was very well done. Everything along the way was interesting, relevant, consistent and told its history eloquently and honestly. It was a place of hope, but also a place of tears.\\n\\nDon&acute;t leave Manhattan without going here. This boat trip may be worthwhile if you were (a) within the earshot of the narration, (b) seated either at the bow of the boat or on the port side where you had a view of Manhattan and (c) hadn&acute;t already been to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island. Unfortunately, we were on the lower level on the starboard side. We couldn&acute;t hear a thing next to the engine and with all the other noisy passengers. And we had already been to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island. In summary, it was a complete waste of 3 hours of time and the money in paying for it.\\n\\nThe only thing we could salvage as it being worthwhile was seeing how Manhattan Island must have originally looked, before it was flattened, by cruising around the northern end. The other plus was that it was a hot day, so the sea breeze was very welcome.\\n\\nThere are SO many more things to do in Manhattan besides this. Followed the storyline of 9/11 and saw pictures of all the victims as well as hearing some stories. It was all done very tastfully with the\\nfamilies of victims considered. In the midst of the \"Concrete Jungle\" there is a magic place to go.\\nInspiring by day, eery by night, it is such a drawcard for all New Yorkers as well as tourists. It is so vibrant with people running, riding bikes, walking alone or with their dogs, it is a home away from home or otherwise an outlet for all to head to at any opportunity. The performers were excellent, young and old. The props and\\ncostumes were brilliant. The only warning I could offer to future\\naudience is to make sure you take a jacket. I went with my two\\nadult daughter and we were in the second row and we froze through the whole performance. One of my daughters was so cold\\nshe put a map over her to try and cover up. The Museum of Modern Art in New York City was everything I anticipated plus more.\\nThe colourful displays of art were both interesting and thought provoking. I went with my 27year old daughter and we thoroughly enjoyed it. It was our favourite museum in New York. Oasis day spa is nestled in the middle of the hustle and bustle that Manhattan has to offer, however, once you step inside, you are transformed into tranquility city. The reception area is cozy and smells so good! The relaxation area is nice and they have tea and water while you wait for your services. Once I was prepped for my massage, I noticed the walls were peeling (not a good impression) and the massage therapist had a foot fan she kept moving around in order to keep cool. Perhpas this had something to do with the fact that she was about 5&acute; tall and very overweight. I am not trying to put her down at all - being overweight myself- however, she was out of breathe quite often and kept interrupting my massage to accomodate the fan. I didnt complain because I did not think it was proper, however if I do return, I will request to have a different therapist.\\n\\nOverall I thought the experience went well but I am not sure I will return anytime soon! As a reward for getting excellent grades in school, I took my daughter to American Girl Place in NYC. This place is absolutely unbelievable. The store itself is beautiful and the best way to describe it is as if you were in an oversized doll house. The staff is efficient and offer very good customer service. They are friendly and accomodating. A MUST SEE if traveling to NYC with small children :) This is a great bar located on the East side. The food is great but their Mimosas ROCK!\\nThe bartender (I&acute;m embarrassed to admit that I forgot his name) is great and kept the drinks coming! There seems to be lots of locals at this bar which makes it a more \"homey\" place rather than just another local tourist attraction. We bought this tour from one of the vendors at $49 per adult for three days. We were able to travel all around the city and the buses passed by pretty frequently. They provide a recorded tour guide in several languages which you can listen to with provided new headphones. The only down side was that must buses were missing the live tour guide, however we were not looking for the type of service so it wasn&acute;t a big deal. You can get pretty amazing pictures of times square from the second level of the bus. Very nice memorial to remember the loss during the 9/11 tragedy. It is advised to get advanced free tickets at the memorial center visitor center located near to St Paul&acute;s Church near to the memorial center Nice view up but no no for the the long queue and big crowd obstructing view. Also elevators were slow to wait and so walking up or down the stairs to the transit level to bring you up/down to ground level will be faster Great harbour cruise finally putting Hollywood to reality. Only gripe was that i got pre-paid tickets off a hotel package deal and so, had them in yellow printed tickets from the vendor&acute;s counter. However, wasn&acute;t told I had to exchange them again into cruise tickets with an agent by the side of the road at the Liberty stop. Was a frustration having to go hunt down the agent after a long queue at the attraction entrance. Otherwise, nice tour Esse lugar Г© especial para os cinefilos pois a Grand Central Terminal jГЎ foi cenГЎrio de diversos filmes.

Having been to New York before and doing all the standard tourist sites before, I thought this would be a fun way to get a little bit off the beaten track and eat lots of lovely things along the way!! I have to say that I was a little bit disappointed on what I expected the day to be like, versus how it actually panned out - but it was still an unusual way to spend an afternoon if you go into it with your eyes open!\\n\\nThe first stop was a shop which specialises in teeny, tiny little cup cakes - literally bite size. We could pick what we wanted (with a few exceptions), and it was nice - but this set the scene for the rest of the tour! We then moved on to the second shop, where the tour guide bought a mixed box of mini cupcakes, it was first come, first served for the flavour you wanted!\\n\\nOnwards to the gelato shop which had some gorgeous looking treats, however again we didn&acute;t get to choose our own - the host instead bought a large tub of mango sorbet and gave us a spoonful each. Some did get the chance of a second spoon, but of all the things on display, mango sorbet really was the least appetising, so I personally declined!\\n\\nWe then walked through Washington Square and into the heart of Greenwich Village. We stopped at Milk and Cookies, where the host had pre ordered a normal size cookie for us. Then we went in to Mollies - where we were told we would design our own cupcake - infact we were given a handful of options for the cake and the frosting and we told the girls behind the counter to make up the (full size) combination we wanted. The final stop was the Magnolia Bakery where we were given a mini red velvet cupcake.\\n\\nWhile most of the treats were delicious, and there is no doubt that if we had eaten full size 6 cakes on the trot we would have been pretty sick, I found the whole thing a bit underwhelming and not really what I thought I was signing up for - especially as this tour costs $50\\n\\nOur guide was friendly but essentially functioned to just go in the shop and buy the goods for us. I enjoyed walking around the Village and soaking up the atmosphere, but I feel I would have had a better time if I had just googled cupcake shops and walked round them myself - at least then I would have got what I wanted in every shop!! Having visited New York before and only viewed the Statue of Liberty from the Staten Island ferry (which is a free way to get the experience), we decided this time to pre book tickets to the Island via Statue Cruises (the official transporter to the island). We also took the chance to book a ticket for access to the crown, which proved to be a good idea as on the day, no tickets were available at the ticket office.\\n\\nWe enjoyed the whole experience immensely, and I would thoroughly recommend it. Being that close to the lady herself was pretty aweinspiring, and I got some great photographs! The ticket also gets you access to Ellis Island which was also very interesting. However here are a few things worth noting as a visitor:\\n\\n1. If you have bought a timed ticket online, you must make sure you arrive before then, to get through security etc. We werent held to the time for boarding the boat or access the island, but it wasn&acute;t that busy the day we went, and ok think they would get stricter when it&acute;s more busy.\\n\\n2. There are 2 sets of security to go through (one before you get on the boat and one before you go into the statue). Both with airport style scanners etc - you have to remove all coats, scarfs and hats etc etc. There is no restriction on liquids, but it&acute;s worth nothing this when considering what to wear on the day you go!\\n\\n3. If you are accessing the crown, you can&acute;t take any bag with you - only what you can carry in terms of a bottle of water, camera etc. Bags are left in a locker for a charge of $2.\\n\\n4. The climb up to the first platform is quite a few steps - so you need to be able to tackle them!\\n\\n5. The climb up to the crown is via a very tight, very steep and within a very dark and confined spiral staircase. Coming down was a as bad as going up!! I had expected lots of steps, but not the nature of them! If you suffer with small spaces this is not for you!\\n\\n6. The crown itself is also a very confined space, probably only for enough room for about 5 people at a time. The views were great and I loved the fact I made it to the top, but if you just made it to level 1 you wouldn&acute;t be missing that much, as you only get to look out very small windows\\n\\n7. The isn&acute;t much else to to on Liberty Island itself - there is a shop and cafe, and a small museum however\\n\\n8. It&acute;s worth taking the free stop off to Ellis Island if you are interested in the history of New York. The audio guide is very good - although to listen to it end to end, you would probably need quite a lot of time\\n\\n9. If you want to make the most of your time down this part of town, you can visit the Freedom Tower and the 9/11 memorial within 10 mins walk of the ferry stop We took advantage of the last free hour of the day so didn&acute;t see much. However, really enjoyed their museum gift shop. If you want to pay the entrance fee, you&acute;d most likely see more but having an hour was enough for us during our busy NYC trip. We loved this grand place and especially had fun at the whispering corners. There were many specialty food choices and the grocery store was amazing. Definitely worth a stop during your trip to New York City. We&acute;ve taken several tours from Viator around the world. Some were okay and this one was outstanding. Mainly due to Tyler the tour guide from Brooklyn. She was amazing and added so much information and fun. The tour takes you early evening for a walk on the High Line (renovated train track now park through Manhattan), past 911 Memorial, on the New York City Taxi around the harbor at night and past the Statue of Liberty. Next it goes through SoHo, Greenwich Village and a stop at Grand Central Station and Rockfeller Square. It was fantastic and lasted about 4 hours. Lots of good information we could use earlier in our trip but sad we took this almost at the end of our stay. This is a must do trip early in your vacation to get the most out of New York City. You won&acute;t be disappointed. Absolut wonderful...i tried THE empire State building to some also has Nice views ,but its less crowded here it seems...... I liker it Г\\xa0 lot. It was very nice to see the Statue of Liberty again! The views of Manhattan are spectacular. Not surprisingly, we had to go through \"airport style \"security prior to getting on the boat and head over to liberty Island. Once We got over there, we were told that we could not take a backpack into the Pedestal. So we had to pay two dollars to store our backpack. The \"high-tech \"locker system takes a scan of your fingerprint to help ensure that lockers don&acute;t get broken into. Then, after waiting in line to enter the pedestal, there is yet another layer of \"airport style\" security. Like what could I have possibly picked up between there and the last security I went through before getting on the boat? I could not help thinking that that money could have been better spent on other infrastructure projects. Oh, and the fingerprint detection software would not work when we went to get our bag. We had to wait for someone to override the computer network in order for us to get our bag out. This is a one shop stop; everything...nature, zoo, skating, walking, running, carriage ride, you name it. Don&acute;t leave the city without a walk in Central Park. Everything here is great; a worthy experience. Be sure to see the African Art and the Egyptian floor. Just keep going back often, as the collection is huge. It will take many visits to even scratch the surface Although David was nice and knowledgeable, he was not a good tour leader. He could not hold our group&acute;s attention and didn&acute;t really try to. This made it hard for those of us who were wanting to take good pictures and learn something. He took us to great photo spots but kind of just left us to take pictures without any real advice, even something basic like angles. I definitely saw more of Central Park than I ever would have on my own, and I appreciate that. But, I would take a different tour and not this one. David was interested in shadows and more natural type photography than scenery and touristy shots. The Inside Broadway tour was fun and informative. I knew maybe half of the info given but it is always good to be reminded, and I really enjoyed this easy walk just looking at the theater buildings. Brigid was a very good tour guide...organized, personable, with good knowledge of the history of Broadway along with current opinions of shows. I noticed that she tailored her show recommendations to who was asking her about what show(s) to see. Beautiful synagogue in an historic neighborhood. Sylvia was the docent for our tour. She did an excellent job of explaining the history of the neighborhood and of the synagogue. We felt a little rushed but the synagogue was preparing for a special event, and we were told by a couple of staff members that we were free to walk around and take pictures after our tour. All of the staff were friendly. The tour at the Tenement museum is good. We went on the Sweatshop tour. What we saw and heard was interesting but we were left wanting to know about the rest of the building. That may be the point, to encourage repeat visitors but it is strange because we could see other portions of the tenement as we walked up the stairs. The staff seemed knowledgable and helpful. Top of the Rock is definitely the one to choose if trying to decide between it and the Empire State Building. The views are magnificent, including the one of the Empire State Building! We were able to walk in and immediately buy a ticket at a kiosk in the office on the concourse level. Most people walked by the films about the building but we watched all three and thought they were good. The only negative was the creepy photographer who was pretty obnoxious. We passed him by. There are 3 levels. The middle level has the smallest crowd. You did not have to jockey for a camera shot there. We went up 30 minutes before dusk and could barely step onto the third level. Crowds were already 2 deep to get pics of the lights coming on across downtown. This was the most fun my 22 year old daughter and I had on my trip to NYC! We took a 10 am tour with Eric. The sunlight was gorgeous over the city, and we had the best views of Manhattan and the Statue of Liberty! Eric was so friendly, informative and considerate. This trip truly deserves the 5 stars I gave it for the views, the tour guide/captain, and the just plain fun factor! We sat in the back facing backward and loved our seat. We got splashed very little. There is a place on the boat to store small backpacks and purses. Eric did not suggest a tip but we happily gave one to such a deserving tour guide/captain I have been to New York twice. The first time I went I did the Empire State Building lookout. On my more recent trip, I did Top of the Rock.\\n\\nI found Top of the Rock to be a MUCH better experience over all. The lines were much shorter and the view was more unobstructed.\\n\\nThey have several decks to view from aswell as an option to stay inside and look out if you find it too chilly or windy.\\n\\nYou can clearly see Central Park, several of the brides, Empire State Building, Trump Building and the MET.\\n\\nIt was only about an 8-10 minute walk from Times Square. My mother and I had relatives pass through Ellis Island so it was absolutely one of the top things we planned to see during our short visit to New York City. We bought our tickets in advance, as we were recommended to do by various people on this website. It was nice to be able to bypass the ticket line and head straight for security. We arrived around 10am at the boat and the boat was already loading. It was a friday morning and early February so it wasnt very busy. Maybe 30 - 40 people were on that boat load.\\n\\nWe had no interest in stopping at the Statue of Liberty and just took pictures from the boat which provided a very good view. We arrived at Ellis Island around 1030 and headed straight to see the film they show on the history of the island and some of the immigrants who passed through. Its a 45 minute show including the introduction but WELL worth the time. Watch it before you walk around the museum so you can really get your head into that space - makes a big difference to know what things were like before. We spent about 2 hours at the museum but could have spent much more time there. There seem to be little doors everywhere that lead to another exhibit. Be sure to read all the information listed with the pictures and take a moment to just sit and imagine what it was like for those who passed through a 100 years ago. I went to see Wicked the weekend of February 11th along with 5 other close friends. We were sitting in the front section of the upper balcony (seats that ran at about $100 a ticket.) I was a little worried about how high up we were but was pleasantly suprised. Like other reviewers said, I dont think there is a bad view from anywhere at the Gershwin.\\n\\nNow I am a musical theatre junkie... In my 24 years on this earth ive probably seen about 13 shows (and itd be more if I didnt live on the westcoast of Canada where we dont get that many!) WICKED is right up there with Les Miserables and Phantom of the Opera as far as quality goes. It is a show that is enjoyable for ALL ages with fantastic talent, set design, costumes and music. If you get a chance to see it I would highly recommend you see it.\\n\\nIf you need any more convincing on how much I loved it - it is now touring across Canada and I just spent another $100 to see it in my home city of Vancouver this coming June. Dont miss out on this one - its worth the cash! been here many times, at various times of year, and almost always book hotels in this area. Will likely not do this in future. The last couple of times, it is overwhelming crowded, and crazy, particularly in the evenings. I would not recommend taking small children with you, (it would be very easy to loose them, or for them to get overwhelmed) unless it is during off season.lots of things to see in NYC. For first time visitors, people who hate crowds, or want a relaxing vacation, I would recommend visiting Times Square for the experience, but concentrate the rest of the visit to the rest of the city attractions. I have seen this show in a couple of other places and loved it. I had an expectation that the Broadway production would top them all but was a little disappointed that it didn&acute;t quite meet the standards that I expected. Some of the acting was really good, however, for me it was a mixed bag. Overall a fun night, but if asked if would I go see this particular production again, probably not. enjoyed this show, well interpreted and enacted. Lots of underlying messages in the storyline, and good fun. I have been meaning to reivew Accomplice NY but just haven&acute;t gotten the opportunity. My family - husband and two daughers - 14 and 16 signed up for this during our trip to NYC in June. We are from out of town but the other family in our group were local. It was a great way to see New York and one of the most unique experiences you will have. Part of the fun was not knowing what you are getting in to so I won&acute;t divulge any more.There is a lot of walking. Lovely views of the statue and for free. We got a coffee before we got on and enjoyed the ride. Came straight back, worth the queue Always worth a photo! Looked good from the bus tour. Never going to get the iconic shot though, still good to see Excellent interactive area for children of all ages, only small but several things to do and books or grown up too Hadn&acute;t read about this park but we stumbled across it and had lunch siting out in the sunshine. Was lovely, there was also a number of activities you could participate in If you suffer from museum fatigue - this is the perfect way to see and hear some bite size but culturally enriching aspects of art/culture and history! Fun and engaging - Harry was a great &acute;guide&acute; but more like a mischievous expert being naughty and revealing the best bits of a treasure trove of a museum! If you want something different - this is for you, and don&acute;t expect it to be like what you would expect a museum tour to be like! The displays are interesting and help visitors get to grips with the city, it&acute;s origins and how it works now. As with everything in New York it is not cheap to take the family but you can stay as long as you like and there are several levels, wear layers include hats and scarves and don&acute;t forget your camera. The interactive light room was good fun and the staff were all fantastic. The views are spectacular. So little is free in New York but notwithstanding the cafes, and other retail opportunities the park is just wonderful. The skating can be watched from the park if you don&acute;t fancy giving it a go. Take some nuts and you will see plenty of squirrels and birds. There are so many surprises within the park the kids and adults all had a lovely few hours exploring. There are bikes and carriages everywhere but it is possible just to wander following the many maps around the \"trails\". Just get a hotdog or picnic and enjoy! We visited over Christmas having been promised an exciting and interactive visit into the world of Spying. What it actually was was a complete rip off, it was 27 dollars per person and the info available inside a pitch black building was pitiful. We all love the discovery channel and they should be ashamed of themselves for passing this off as an exciting and action packed exhibition. The 20 second light beam room was the highlight for us. Only one of the voice changers was operational. The information available was not in a form that appealed to most of the children, so many parents were equally disappointed. The exhibits are mostly static and the commentary is a further 7 dollars per machine - we took one but it too was poor. Our tip - go to the Met get there early and spend a day it&acute;s great for all ages, the houses within the museum and the Egyptian temple are fascinating. This is a fabulous use of space which provided a welcome relief from the chaos of NYC whilst still in the middle of the action. Make sure you try the Mexican Ice Pops and the Tacos on sale on the route. Both were delicious. A great addition to NYC tourism Visited Top of the Rocks during mid-day. Definitely worth the money. I purchased combined ticket with MOMA (you save 5 or 10$), You get a great view and i didn&acute;t find it crowded at all. Amazing view of Manhattan: Central Park, Empire State etc. I would recommend this over the Empire State Building. A must do! Ended up spending a good hour there. Central Park is truly amazing. Absolutely huge - running around the park is a great way to discover it. I went three times and yet, I haven&acute;t explored all of it. Very well presented and creatively situated in the foundations of the South Tower. Lots and lots of information and all presented in a respectful way. However, some of the very personal inclusions (like answer machine messages) felt a bit ghoulish & I felt uncomfortable after a while. The audio tour was of great quality (Robert de Niro&acute;s commentary particularly) but we found it quite hard match up with the exhibits around the museum. Included in the excellent value NY City Pass. Having a timed entry ticket was a great idea as we were up at the top within 15 minutes. Rather restricted space at the top but incredible views all around. Great to spend a sunny Sunday morning with all the native New Yorkers, jogging or cycling or just soaking up the relaxed atmosphere Good tour routes. Convenient schedule. Goods buses. Helpful staff. Only seeing tours: very difficult to hear anything the tour guide says. The voice system definitely needs improvement. Governor&acute;s Island is a perfect way to escape the fuzz and noise from Manhattan. Take the free ferry from lower Manhattan or Brooklyn and enjoy a peacefull day on this small island. You&acute;ll have great views on the Manhattan skyline and Lady Liberty. You can easily spend a full day there, just wandering around, ride a bike, eat an icecream, relax on one of the grassfields and enjoy the scenery.\\nDefinitely recommended for people with kids too. Bring your picknick!! ;-) The Intrepid is my favourite thing to do in New York. I love anything to do with planes, so I loved seeing all the jets on deck, but my wife (who was dreading it) absolutely loved it too. It&acute;s fascinating to visit the crew quarters and see how 3000 people all lived on the ship. Make sure you pay the extra to visit the Space Shuttle too. I was like a little child with excitement when I saw it, it&acute;s simply mindblowing. The only downside is that the food in the cafe (Bon au Pain) is crazy expensive - $12 a sandwich, so make sure you visit with full bellies.\\n\\nGoing to New York? GO TO THE INTREPID!!! Went to the museum with my wife as part of the Statue of Liberty cruise and as part of a New York Pass package. I thought the Ellis Island museum was outstanding. Very well presented and very informative. We hired two audio cassettes which were easy to use and provided valuable information as we looked round. You need at least 3 hours to see everything properly. The computer research facility was very good and I would thoroughly recommend it. If you think a relative was processed here take as much information with you as possible and for a nominal fee you can trace their records eg ships manifest details If/Then is a musical, alternating between two stories about Elizabeth, a woman who returns to NYC at the age of 39 to start anew after a bad marriage took her to Phoenix for several years. When she arrives, she is greeted by two friends, one old who calls her Beth and one new, who calls her Liz. Beth and Liz embark on two separate paths for the next few years, each path has its rewards, heartaches, happiness and disappointments. The cast is wonderful, as are the songs. Idina Menzel is a Broadway mega-star with a voice that shakes the rafters. If you want to see the best voice on Broadway, then see this show. Once is an unusual musical for Broadway. No dancing, no orchestra, only one set with props moved by the performers. Instruments are played by the performers on stage, virtually all strings, with the exception of one accordion. The story revolves around a boy and girl who meet in a sort of Irish open mic bar. It is a very low budget production with no set changes and few props and the performers doubling as the orchestra. Very different, but good. I would recommend. I see 20 Broadway shows/year and had never been to The Lion King. I never saw the point of going to a live performance of a cartoon. Now I know why I was avoiding it. The costumes and puppets are outstanding. Unfortunately, that&acute;s all there is to this show. The performances are mediocre and it is overly long due to numerous, pointless dance sequences. If you have small children, they may enjoy the costumes and won&acute;t realize the performers are just average, so they might enjoy it. The theater is huge and brand new, so the seating is more comfortable than most on Broadway, but the show itself, just average. For some reason we decided to check out Ha! on Manhattan, and boy do we regret this. Only 6 people including us in a huge room with lousy comedians (I know it&acute;s hard to work a room with so few people, but these guys were terrible) and a very, very annoying waitress constantly interrupting the bad show trying to get us to buy more. Stay away. And wished i had left in the intermission.\\n\\nHad been planning to see this for some time. A show that runs for over 8 years must be doing something right , so we decided to see it on Broadway.....For us it was just too loud, repetitive, slow in parts and silly. However, the song \"Defying gravity\" is a killer track and the leading lady really belted it out. If you enjoyed \"The Jersey Boys\" - you will love this and the leading lady`s performance was utterly brilliant and believable! We went in February and it was so so so cold! However it made for a perfect horse carriage ride around Central Park. We had blankets to keep us warm! A must do as a tourist. Consistently provides the best talent and programs anywhere. Avery Fisher Hall is for the NY Philharmonic and provides an excellent venue to see the symphony with acoustics to match. Be certain to visit for the best in performing arts. Not the easiest site in Manhattan to visit, but worth the cab fare, or take mass transit (but plan for a longer ride). Simply a wonderful exhibit. Very educational. Never knew such historical wonders would be located in such a great city. This should not be missed when visiting NY. Make sure you allow several hours to see the museum. Prebook tickets so you don&acute;t miss out as it gets very busy in holiday season. A must to do in winter in NY. Very cold so make sure you rug up. However it&acute;s nicer to visit Central Park in the warmer months. Ramin was excellent as Jean Valjean. The Imperial is a great cosy theatre right in the centre of Midtown',\n",
              " 'This is a fun putt-putt golf attraction, but it does not have a lot of \"over-the-top\" putt-putt novelties like you might find at Disney or areas like Myrtle Beach. I&acute;d rate the course itself as three stars, but I did get two holes in one, so that&acute;s worth the extra star. :-) Also, the volcano in the middle of the course is not to be missed. It routinely \"erupts\" throughout your game -- fun and impressive! You do not need to worry about getting wet at this attraction. You will be on an elevated boardwalk throughout the activity. You walk along a portion of the river that is churning with rapids. It is a beautiful and stunning walk. We bought the Adventure Pass that provides access to the White Water Walk, Nature&acute;s Fury, Hornblower Cruises, and Journey Behind the Falls. Each activity is unique and fun. The gardens along the Canadian side of the Falls area are spectacular. I liked the view you get from the side of the falls. Is really majestic and you feel the water so powerful. The tunnel that takes you behind the falls is a little disappointing because even though you do feel the power of the water there isn&acute;t much to see. We went to the Buffet Summit and the food was ok, but there wasn&acute;t a lot of variety. The views were amazing and it worth going to the observation floor for 360 degree views of Niagara Falls, Canada and the USA. This is a once in a lifetime experience that everyone should enjoy at least once. Take the Hornblower cruise and get close to the beautiful falls, is worth every penny. Just stunning, worth a visit at least once in your life. This is one of the finest botanical gardens I have ever visited, though the day I was there was so hot I had to cut my visit a bit short. The grounds are well-maintained and the staff is very friendly. The only admission fee (unless you go in the butterfly exhibit) is for parking. I parked about a half a mile south at another park and walked right in. I highly recommend it! We found a $1 off coupon in a book we picked up at the Ontario visitor&acute;s center so that was nice. Price wasn&acute;t terrible at $10, we thought it might be much more. The ride was nice and we ended up making at least 3 revolutions and with the loading and unloading, it might have been almost 4. The cars swung more than I would have thought and that was a little nerve wrecking. The view of the falls at night is Ok but it&acute;s not great, perhaps it&acute;s better in the daytime (when we were not there). Enjoyed the ride nonetheless. I have no idea why there are any negative comments about this - we loved it - well organised and allowed a really up close look at the falls!',\n",
              " 'Filled with people both day and night, the Promenade is truly one of the highlights of a Nice visit. Teal blue sea on one side and beautiful architecture on the other make this 10km stretch of palm tree lined roadway a delight to explore and people watch. The Promenade is wide with plenty of beach access points and has a dedicated bike path.\\n\\nTake note that there is little in the way of food or drink stops, aside from the couple of big hotels across the road. Once you get away from the old town area, there are virtually no businesses until you near the airport. We biked from the old town to out past the airport looking for a waterside cafe and finally ended up at Port de Saint-Laurent-du-Var which is a wonderful lunch stop with it&acute;s 20 or so cafes but it&acute;s a good distance from central Nice. It&acute;s an easy walk up or down the hill and there&acute;s an elevator if you&acute;re so inclined. There are a couple of viewing areas from which to catch a view of the surrounding areas, the best being the Collin du Chateau Overlook.\\n\\nWe packed a lunch and were hoping for a quiet picnic spot at the top but the park at the top is mostly playground and the volume of screaming children and throngs of guided tours pushed us to explore further which worked out well as there is a lot to this site and it&acute;s worth a bit of hiking around.\\n\\nA few other reviews suggested visiting at sunset which would probably be nice but sunset in June is between 21-21:30 and the park closes with gates locked up tight at 19:00 (7:00 pm) so really, one would have to go early or late in the season to catch twilight from the top. The old town area of Nice is all about restaurants and bars. There are some cute shops certainly souvenirs to be had but by and large it&acute;s all about the food and there are some great eating establishments. Whether you are craving seafood, pizza, Thai or something else, you have plenty of option in the Nice old town and after the meal, the options for gelato are almost as vast.\\n\\nThe shuttered ocher-colored buildings catch the late afternoon light in a way that makes for some great photographic opportunities as well. It&acute;s not the best preserved or the most beautiful old town in Europe but it&acute;s quaint, filled with friendly locals and a great place to visit. Take the time to walk through the cemeteries. Some of the inscriptions are quite moving. We enjoyed the lovely vistas from the Place Massena We felt that it was not worth the time unless you really like Chagall. Enjoy the views of the sea and the city from the Promenade des Anglais. We enjoyed walking the narrow streets of the Vieille Ville.',\n",
              " 'We loved this. The guides were knowledgeable and engaging) the walk was interesting, we had fun going over the rope bridges. Lunch on the Savanah was brilliant. Crocs, lions tigers giraffes, cheetahs, rhinos- who needs to take that long flight to Africa?

The rides have totally outdated waiting system and on some you will stand without moving for 15min/move on SUN and it will take you like an hour to come to top and have 20s ride...come on...on top of that floor gets so hot you can&acute;t stand with bare feet and of course you can&acute;t take slipers to rides.\\n\\nPeople working here are sooo bored and non friendly looking that you notice immediately. Life guards in wave pool suck beyond imagination.\\n\\nAlmost all strolers on sun, want shade? Pay up sucker...\\n\\nYou can only bring in bottled water and 3oz snack....they will take other things away from you and dump it!\\n\\nFood inside - hugely overpriced, jucky and again you will waiiiittt indefinetly....\\n\\nAgreed, small children like it, since for them the wave pool is fun enough. But this park is parents nightmare deluxe. Inefficiency is so bad that it hurts to look.\\n\\nWould give 2 stars, but daughter had fun. We live in D.C. and have seen the 4th of July fireworks every year except this year. They just don&acute;t do it for me anymore. I am jaded. So the Wishes fireworks is small and short in comparison, not that exciting. Fireworks I dream of seeing are the ones in NY 4th and New Year&acute;s day Hong Kong, but you can keep your Wishes. I was so excited to see this show. We sat in the pouring rain for like an hour. It was impressive at first, then afterwards, not so. I am used to Cirque Du Soleil and our numerous video games on an Xbox, even the Disney Land Kinect game was more impressive than this show. It&acute;s good to go for the first time to see what all the commotion is about, but to go a second time, I wouldn&acute;t bother. You have to go an hour early and it&acute;s a 20 minute show. As I said I am pretty jaded so something like this or even a Ringling and Barnum Circus is not going to excite me these days. We were in the third row, front center, and Mickey and all the characters were just to small. Live shows like this are no good. I am not the type to watch a Super Bowl or any concert live anymore. Why? When you can see everything live and in a more stunning and close up view on your digital flat screen tv. Even Broadway doesn&acute;t impress me these days. I have been too spoiled by the HD graphics that even live is not good enough so try Fantasmic once. Place used to be good, but now it is just too overcrowded with tourists and especially, locals. This past Saturday night was the worst, there was even an employee in the sidewalks directing foot traffic with a flashlight. The restaurants are not that great and overpriced. The Disney stores are good, but they are way over priced for Disney junk, which 100% is made in China crap. Plus you can get better deals from Disney online. Not worth it to go here, but my kid loves the Lego store and kept begging so we had no choice. That is one of the most crowded chaotic stores, and in the end you can get cheaper legos at Toys &acute;r us when they have specials or on amazon.com where I bought a set after applying for their credit card and getting $30 off. Great experience and loved the variety of food tastings and beverages. Friendly environment and loved the fireworks! We had a magical day at Magic Kingdom, however the long lines in will call took away an hour and half away form our experience. I love this park because it has something for every member of the family. I love traveling around the countries and my daughter always finds things to do. For example one time she did the passport stamps in every country. Another time she collected the pressed pennies from all the countries. You always find new experiences every time you go. Our favorite rides are Fast Track, Nemo, Spaceship Earth and you definitely have to see Soarin&acute;. We attended the Wine and Food festival this November and this event was excellent. You are able to taste many dishes from 30 different countries. This park has something to do for the entire family. It is a big park so be ready to do plenty of walking, but with all the trees, it has lots of shade to protect you from the sun. My favorite attractions are the Safari, Dinosaurs, Bug&acute;s Life, The Lion King Show and Mount Everest. I love this waterpark because is family friendly. It has rides for all ages and you also get the Disney experience. They offer lockers and towels and they have a good variety of food choices. It is definitely a park to enjoy all day long. This show changes every time I watch it and it always gets better. This is definitely something you don&acute;t want to miss. The show, music, lights and fireworks are magical. This show is worth watching. The music, fireworks and screen show are amazing. Is the perfect ending to a great day at Epcot. My family and I had a great time at this waterpark. It has attractions for all ages and many are family friendly. The lines were not bad and we were able to ride attractions multiple times. They offered a good variety of food choices at reasonable prices. Loved every minute of it! Sadly my friend didn&acute;t as she doesn&acute;t like heights! I am giving this abomination 1 star beacuse it isn&acute;t possible on this forum to score less.\\n\\nMake no mistake, this is the very worst of the worst. My family and I went there for Christmas dinner last year (2007) and felt as if we had been held down and mugged at the end. The show is a joke, the acting is atrocious, the service non-existent, and the food...well, that deseves a paragraph all of its own.\\n\\nTo say it was inedible would be an understatement, as it was vile in the extreme, and served in the dark so you couldn&acute;t see that it was one or two stages below pig-swill. It was served airplane style from people who were thuggish, loud and who genuinely seemed to think they were doing a great job of serving up a gustatory delight.\\n\\nThe \"unlimited beer and wine\" was just a flat-out lie. I took a taxi there and back, at a cost of $110 from Lake Davenport, in anticipation of an evening of good food and a bountiful plentitude of tasty beverages. Wrong!! 2 plastic cups of watered down slop masquerading as bad beer is all we were allowed, unless we wanted to pay a great deal extra at the cash bar.\\n\\nWe had the worst seats in the place, but were graciously allowed to upgrade at an extortionate rate, which we declined.\\n\\nI could go on about this place all day, but I think you will get the jist. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!! Go to McDonalds instead for your culinary treat. At least you generally won&acute;t get ptomaine poisoning. Yes, ptomaine poisoning. How does this place stay open? This is one of our favourite places in Walt Disney World, we always visit when we&acute;re in Orlando as we love the experience. Ok so its fake but there are some really good shows in several &acute;countries&acute; and the buildings are such good replicas, small children probably find its a bit boring compared to the rest of EPCOT. My favourite part is Italy, great restaurants & love Venice! You need to allow at least an afternoon and evening to get the best out of it.\\nIn England you can bump into Pooh, Eeyore & Tigger and The Rose & Crown is the only pub/bar in Orlando that I have found my favourite drink - Pimms no 1, you can eat fish & chips and have a great spot to watch IllumiNations - fireworks & light show on the lake, great entertainment! We have seen this show twice and were lucky to have preferential seating the second time because we booked a table in one of the restaurants in the park before the show, little ones might get a bit fidgety as you do need to get there early to get a good seat. Very impressive show with all the Disney characters. Absolutely love these displays, we have seen them countless times and quite honestly they are just fabulous! When we visit Orlando we would never miss a visit to The Magic Kingdom, its obviously best to get there early for a good spot in the park in front of the castle. We like to book a table in the Crystal Palace restaurant with Pooh & friends and then view the display from their terrace, you won&acute;t be dissapointed with either, altogether a great evening&acute;s entertainment. My husband & I recently went to Florida to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary and we are very much into middle/old age. This was our fourth trip in fourteen years and our first as just a couple. We just had to go to MK, we even did &acute;Its A Small World&acute; again!\\nWe love Disney & yes there are lots of crowds & the queues can be long but there is just no other place like it! We booked a character meal for 7.30pm in The Crystal Palace with Winnie the Pooh & his friends and then we were in great place on their verandah to see the fireworks, which is the highlight and never fail to be anything other fantastic.\\nNo-one does it like Disney, its all wonderful and we love it! Loved everything. Need to book early as only 1000 area allowed in each day, all inclusive except for photos and souvenirs. Our daughters adored the dolphin swim, very highly recommended You can&acute;t go wrong with this one. Get there as early as you can, find a place in the shade. Bring flip flops and rent a locker. Like all the Disney resorts, food will be pricey. However, the portions are huge. So you can get to meals and easily split four ways. Tip: buy refillable soda mug. Also - get on Cross Country creek too cool down and rest your feet while getting transported to your next ride. Our favorite ride: Teamboat Springs. Estive pela primeira neste parque agora em junho e gostei bastante do dia passado lГЎ. Na minha opiniГЈo as melhores atraГ§Гµes sГЈo a montanha-russa do Aerosmith, o elevador do Hollywood Hotel e a apresentaГ§ГЈo do American Idol. TambГ©m achei que a ГЎrea de alimentaГ§ГЈo prГіximo Г\\xa0s entradas da montanha-russa e do elevador oferece as melhores opГ§Гµes de todos os parques da Disney. Parque para a famГ\\xadlia, com atraГ§Гµes para todos os gostos e idades. Como nГЈo se impressionar com os shows da Shamu, dos golfinhos e dos leГµes marinhos, e como nГЈo sentir um frio na barriga com um passeio na Manta ou na Kraken? Esperva mais do show. Achei interessante pela tecnologia usada, de projeГ§ГЈo de imagens em cortinas de ГЎgua, mas esperava mais emoГ§ГЈo. Foi minha primeira vez a uma apresentaГ§ГЈo do Cirque du Soleil e achei simplesmente impressionante. Apesar de o ingresso ser caro (na minha opiniГЈo vale a pena pagar um pouco mais para ficar mais prГіximo do palco), vale cada centavo. Na minha opiniГЈo a melhor queima de fogos de todos os parques de Orlando. BelГ\\xadssimo encerramente para um dia de muita diversГЈo. On my original plans, I was only going to do the park from 9A-2P. I stayed the entire day and didn&acute;t experince everything. I can see where teenagers and kids may get bored as there isn&acute;t the intensity in rides. Though, the Mission to Mars ride would make anybody almost scream their head off!\\n\\nThe Candelight procession event was well worth the extra investment. It was a great chistmas show. It got us dinner reservations at the Morrocan Marrakesh restaurant! I recommend this place for those wanting exotic. We got special seating for both the show and fireworks.\\n\\nFor a quick lunch, I recommend the french bistro.\\n\\nIf you arrive early, get the fast pass or get inline for the more popular rides. would This is a beautiful shrine very near Disney and Orlando. Take a break from the hustle of the area and stop in for Mass or a visit! There is a lovely garden, some beautiful art work and the choir for Sunday (9am) Mass is a treat for classical music lovers!',\n",
              " 'This is where the nautical museums are to be found, the Viking museum, the Fram, the Kon Tiki and the Maritime museum. Buses, ferries and hop on hop off buses all stop here. Besides the museums there is a small park with nautical themed statues and relics giving a great view over the Oslo waterfront and fjord. Further round is a small beach popular with the locals. Local buses stop here. On the peninsula are lovely wooden houses too. This was an amazing journey. It exceeded my expectations. It had snowed recently and it was still lying. The snow sparkled in the sunshine. We saw lakes, fjords, waterfalls, pretty wooden houses and raging rivers. I travelled in komfort class and took advantage of complementary hot drinks. The seats were comfortable with plenty of leg room and areas to stand and enjoy the passing scenery. I look forward to doing the journey again. It took 6 1/2 hours. Highly recommended ! Sadly this exhibition is in need of a revamp. It was opened in 1970 and little has changed since then. This is a pity as the content is interesting and unique. They have part of a bomb dropped on the Tirpitz. There are several recreated scenes where miniature soldiers and cotton wool have been used. It needs to be expanded and brought up to date. A visit to the National Gallery is a must. They have a room full of Munch paintings including the &acute;Scream&acute;, &acute;Madonna&acute; and many others. The exhibition is designed so that the audience takes a walk through history to 1950. It is a small gallery and the paintings are on one floor.. I was disappointed by this museum. I had an Oslo Pass so entry was free. Otherwise I wouldn&acute;t have visited. On the ground floor are some wooden boats and wooden bow figures. There is a small exhibition of nautical scenes. Upstairs is an exhibition which I think is probably for children with story boards and small items. If time is short or you&acute;re paying for entrance don&acute;t bother with this one. It cannot compare to its neighbouring museums of the Fram and Kon-Tiki which are highly rated. Give this one a miss ! In the museum is the original Kon Tiki boat shipped back from the Pacific. The museum tells the story of Thor Heyerdahl&acute;s expeditions on balsa wood and reed boats across the Pacific and Atlantic oceans in Kon-Tiki, Ra and Ra II. There is a not to be missed, film in the cinema. There are photographs and stories of his companions. There are explanations of the scientific work conducted by the team on Easter Island and the Galapagos in order to support his theories of early boat travel and migration.. Well worth a visit ! Highly recommended !!! The Fram museum tells the story of polar exploration. From Amundsen beating Scott to the South Pole to the quest to find the North West Passage. The museum tells the story of Amundsen&acute;s voyage and discovery of the North West Passage, his later air flight over the North Pole in a Zeppelin type baloon and his tragic death in search of survivors of a plane crash. The museum was built around the ship Fram in one large hall. A second hall is constructed around the second ship Goja. They are connected by an underground passage. There is a short film in the Goja building which is worth watching as it explains the history of polar exploration. I certainly learnt a lot from this visit. There are areas for children. You can tour the Fram and see what life would have been like. I highly recommend this museum. It is next door to both the Kon Tiki and Maritime museums. If time is short give the Maritime museum a miss. Loved this museum ! It is simply designed displaying the Viking burial ships and the grave goods. The building is designed like a church with four arms to it. The boats are in three arms and the grave goods in the fourth. There are steps up to viewing balconies so the top and inside of the boats can be seen. I was surprised at how large the bo areats are. They found three ornately carved wooden sleighs amongst the grave goods which are displayed in glass cases. There are cabinets with other finds , explanations and photos. There are boards explaining wood conservation too. This is a must see museum and highly recommended ! I climbed the slope with my husband, and we enjoyed it very much. From faraway, it looked like a beautiful skiing zone. We didn&acute;t enter, just passed by. I loved this park. The landscape was beautiful. It made me feel very calm. Statues are very lovely. I enjoyed them very much. It&acute;s just a must-see. Take the metro to beautyful Sognsvann and have a walk around the lake and/or a barbecue, or go to Frognerseteren for a brisk hike in Nordmaraka. After you could enjoy the views and services of Frognerseteren itself. A modern museum containing contemporary Norwegian music, subcultural exhibitions and interactive elements.',\n",
              " 'we got a three day deal since the price difference was minimal when compared to one day. Overall useful BUT only for two days. Since they only go in one direction and stop at all stops, you cannot use it for daily transport. Also, if a bus breaks down, as it happened to us, the next one may not come for a while. But overall, worth taking a day or two. we did a half day tour and saw the main parts of the palace and quick tour of the gardens. The latter is beautiful, Try to go at a night when they have fireworks and music and other entertainment. The lines are long. We had a tour which helped but the place was crowded. more important than the scenery was seeing how laid back the French are and how they come to the banks with a bottle of wine and picnic. across all ages. even late hours. very chillaxing place to visit with a beautiful pond area. did not go inside the palace. If you spend alot of time in versaille gardens, you can skip this one. We only did a 3 hour tour version but got to see the main stuff. You can spend a whole week here if you want to see everything. Very crowded. Very easy metro access no trip to paris is complete without a trip to eiffel, you should also go all the way to the top. do the lunch at the first floor lunch bistro just for the view and experience. The food is OK too. I read on TripAdvisor about nonavailability of tickets for various Paris attractions or very long lines etc. We had bought a package thru a travel agency and the vendor they used, did not have anything we wanted. So I did a quick search and these guys popped up. Purchased tours in US for Paris. Did the Louvre and the Eiffel lunch and Monet. Overall, was probably worth it since everywhere there were long lines. Also, it was nice to have tour guides telling us whats what since the french don&acute;t have signs or descriptions in english. But if you have time in paris and don&acute;t mind waiting a bit, you really don&acute;t need to buy tours. As far as organization was concerned, they were well organized. Good customer service, The guides were good too and knew their stuff well. They also offered short versions and long versions of everything. My husband and I chose to do the Fat Tire bike tour of Paris on our very first day in the city. It&acute;s a great way to see all the big sites quickly and decide which you&acute;d like to come back to visit in more depth. There is so much to see in Paris, it can be overwhelming, so this is a great orientation!\\n\\nOur guide was great - very funny and knowledgeable. The tour stops in the beautiful Tuileries Gardens where you can sit and order lunch (and a glass of wine!) before finishing the second half of the tour. The bikes are comfortable to ride and though biking in Paris is a little terrifying, our guide always made sure we were safe and accounted for.\\n\\nI&acute;ve done Fat Tire tours now in London and Paris and would highly recommend them - I look for them in every city I visit! This is a must see. Although it can be very hard to appreciate its beauty, if there is any because when we went it was wall to wall people. Instead of having a peaceful existence, it was crowded like it is at a shopping mall. At the very top on the marble or granite plaza overlooking everything as well as the Tower, it truly is wall to wall people. We rented an apartment nearby and I regret not coming very early in the AM, around 6 am just to look at the Eiffel Tower from that vantage point in peace and take photos at sunrise. It&acute;s very true what one reviewer said about going to the gardens on a nice and sunny day. The mood and atmosphere would have been different had it been rainy or cloudy. The mansion and main museum are closed until Sept 2015 for renovations so I would not even bother with the temporary exhibit, and just go for the gardens where Rodin&acute;s famous sculptures are.\\n\\nWe have a 7 year old so he had a blast running around the garden. We spent a good 1.5 hours on such a lovely and warm spring day in April. This is very good for kids. I don&acute;t know if we would feel the same way if the weather was 80 degrees F, where it might feel sweltering and tire one out, but when we went it was good in the 70s. This place would be a once in a lifetime deal, but the flowers were not all in full bloom so my opinion might be different if I had come in May. I recall this museum the first time we went in 2001, and it was so exciting to finally see paintings by Van Gogh, Renoir, Degas, and Gaugin that I had learned about in art history in college. Then I went recently in April 2015, and it was not such a thrill. I suppose it was the best when you have never been. This time around I was tired, sluggish, and bored maybe because I am older? Who knows, but I do recommend you see it once in your lifetime. Most visitors to Paris go to the MusГ©e du Louvre and the MusГ©e d&acute;Orsay but far fewer visit or even know of the Musee National du Moyen Age a.k.a. \"The Cluny Museum\". My wife and I had been to Paris a few times before so we no longer felt any pressure to visit the regular Paris highlights. This museum has always been on our list of places to see while in Paris but we had not actively sought it out and it dropped off the radar each time. On our recent trip, which was primarily just to shop and eat, we put the Cluny at the top of the list and we were not disappointed.\\n\\nThe site itself is a living piece of the past. Built on and around a 3rd century Roman bath house (the Thermes de Cluny), the Gothic structure was built by a wealthy 15th century Benedictine Abbot, Jacques d&acute;Amboise primarily to house visiting monks. The museum contains a varied array of artifacts from the early middle ages through the Renaissance periods including coins, armor, tapestries, weapons, iron and leather work, coins, original sculptures from St. Chapelle and a number of recently discovered statuary from Notre Dame. Of course, the flagship exhibit is The Lady and the Unicorn Tapestries and having seen them so often in photos, on greeting cards, etc, it was pretty awe-inspiring to stand in front of these large, famous tapestries.\\n\\nThere are a lot of reasons to visit the Cluny. The collections are well presented quality artifacts. I&acute;m a art history fan but I hadn&acute;t seen most of the pieces in the collection before which made them very interesting and exciting. The architecture is a worthy exhibit unto itself and parts of the Roman structure, particularly the vaults are available for public access. We didn&acute;t have a Paris *Museum Pass, but it&acute;s absolutely worth the admission at full price. Although the museum is not that large, allow yourself 2-3 hours for a thorough visit.\\n\\n\\n*On a side note regarding the \"Museum Pass\", Although it can be a cost effective way to see a number of historic locations, my observation was that the Museum Pass holders tended to blow through museums and monuments because they seemed to feel pressured to get their moneys worth out of them. In my opinion, that lessens the experience. My wife and I leisurely visited several sites on the Museum Pass list over the five days we spent in Paris and we paid less than the cost of the Pass for that duration and we felt zero pressure. Having greatly enjoyed a Fat Tire Bike Tour in London last month, my wife and I were really looking forward to our ride in Paris. We chose the night ride and it was fun to travel around Paris that way. We covered a lot of ground and it was great to chat with our fellow tourists.\\n\\nUnlike our experience in London, the Paris operation is much larger and it felt less personal. Our guide was a bit over-the-top in his presentation and his facts and analogies were often very exaggerated. Also, his overuse of colloquialisms left a lot of the non-native English speakers in the group with frequent quizzical looks on their faces. I think most of the group tuned him out early on and just enjoyed the ride.\\n\\nThat having been said, I still recommend the tours to my friends and I&acute;ll probably go on the Berlin and Barcelona tours soon. The rides are great and the people you meet are often interesting. The guide you get is really the luck of the draw; you may get some great insights and information or you might just get a nice ride. A walk through La Grande Epicerie du Bon marchГ© is jaw dropping. The food available ranges from top class fresh vegetables, meat, fish, baked and tinned goods to freshly cooked food to take home. All merchandise is well presented and although on the expensive side - the options are mind boggling. Their home ware is extensive. Worth a visit just to drool! For all Picasso enthusiasts - this museum is worth a visit. A cross section of his works are well presented in a building with a lot of attention paid to detail in the exhibition spaces. The Bonnard exhibition closes in 4 or 5 weeks. I didn&acute;t realise how much I loved his work until I saw this exhibition which is highly recommended. Funny, when I read the reviews I thought it was going to be a little tiring to get too - with a massive walk. Not at all. We took the Metro to Anvers walked 100metres up a street with lots of \"tourist stores\" ie selling shirts, bags, berets before we to to the botttom of Sacre Coeur. It was then a few minute walk up, through gardens - with chairs, steep steps, less steep steps to accommodate all.\\n\\nWalking inside the Basilica is very special. It is incredible. Worth just sitting to soak up the atmosphere on a pew inside. Important to be respectful - no talking, no photos (no need to be a tacky tourist). Look up, look down, look sideways.\\n\\nWe did take the Furnacular down (we had an unlimited RATP card) but it would be a few minute walk. After Sacre Couer we wandered to the Moulin Rouge.\\n\\nA reflection. The area of Sacre Coeur has a lot of its arty feel and \"grunge\" from 20 years ago (when I last went). A shame.........\\n\\nGreat for tourists - safe, easy to access and spectacular. The Conciergerie was a disappointment. Our visit was redeemed (and our ticket price justified) by a modern art exhibition with several thought-provoking installations. Hopefully the exhibition will be on when you visit.\\n\\nThe actual museum was rather uninspiring. The English language captions were not comprehensive. There was a lack of multimedia content. (One video that&acute;s all.) There should&acute;ve been audio guides.\\n\\nGiven the drama and significance of what went on there, couldn&acute;t they have done better. The Eiffel Tower is a must if its your first visit to Paris, and you&acute;re not afraid of heights.\\n\\nBest way to do it is purchase your tickets and book your slot on line before you arrive, it will save you quite a bit of queing time.\\n\\nCost per adult to the summit is в‚¬14.50 Though I have been to Paris often, I visited this museum for the first time this September. I wanted to see the photo exhibit on the Liberation of Paris, in August of 1944. It was splendid, though only a very few of the images were in color ( I think the only color shots were stills from George Stevens 16 mm Kodachrome footage ). Go see it ! I have been here dozens of times, and feel that I have hardly scratched the surface. This is, perhaps, the finest art museum in the world - and there is always something new to discover. What brought us here last November was an exhibition of pre revolutionary color photographs taken mostly in rural Russia, between 1904 and 1916 by Serguey Procoudine-Gorsky. It truly was a portrait of a lost world. The technical quality of the photographs was quite impressive.He used some kind of three color separation process, like Technicolor, and there was little fading or color shifting.\\nThere is also, of course, a fine selection of Zadkine&acute;s sculpture. The employees are friendly enough, but not always up on the contents of the collection. One woman at the ticket counter, during a visit last August, told us that she had been sent there on a temporary basis to work, by the local unemployment office. On a more recent visit, however, when I started asking too many questions of a guard, he told me to hang on - and brought the Museum Directrice down from her office to speak with us. She was very gracious, and not bothered at all by the intrusion. The Luxembourg Gardens are very attractive, and very well maintained. They are an oasis of tranquillity inside of a very large city. There is so much to see that if you aren&acute;t planning on spending days at the Louvre - you should really book a tour with a guide to skip the line and hit the highlights. Can be difficult to find since it is completely surrounded by a french office building, and it is often overlooked because Notre Dame is just steps away, but do not miss out on Sainte Chapelle. I have gone nearly every visit to Paris and I am still captivated by the beautiful stained glass, the ceiling, the sculptures, even the floor is beautiful. The chapel is quite small and you need not spend more than an hour, but it will be a wonderful hour. We really enjoyed the two hour Montmartre tour. Our guide, Chris, was very knowledgeable and answered all questions patiently. His anecdotes were very interesting and sometimes even funny!!\\nI have visited Paris a dozen times, but still learned some new things and discoverd places I would have never seen without the tour.\\n\\nThis tour is really a fantastic way to explore the city and I highly recommend it. Don&acute;t forget to tip well afterwards!! ;-) This is such a big and great looking cathedral and the area was really great. Unfortunately, we were not able to get insde due to the long queu. Really good cafes in the area We went twice to the Eiffel Tower. 1st on the night that we arrived. As it was only a short stroll from our hotel we decided to go for a walk before dinner. It was great, walked up the stairs to level one, great view and it was a great night, then walked back down the same stairs. Great exercise. The next day, we went to a previously booked, skip the line tour and it was great. The tour guide was exceptional and boy did he earn a lot of tips!. He was the most vivacious and eloquent tour guide. The Eiffel Tower tour itself was fantastic, great views. Felt sorry for those people waiting in the long queues. Oh well, they must have time! There were thousands of people. I didn&acute;t think it was necessary to go to the 3rd floor as you see the same view only you are in a narrower space. So really, all the people were doing were buying champagne? Trying to be romantic? with a miilion people around you? Whoa. I can definitely give the 3rd floor a miss and miss the TH people. View was fantastic so stay longer in the 2nd floor is what I&acute;m really saying. Walking up to this awe inspiring building on a cool fall morning just took my breath away.\\n\\nI had to stop...and look...and look.\\n\\nYou must avoid the crowds so you have a more intimate experience with the building - the stained glass windows, the many archs, and just the intricate details that were put into the creation of this building.\\n\\nDo yourself a favor and take your time, just be respectful of the religious sanctity of the building.',\n",
              " 'This is the best place to have coffee in Lac Beauport. Luckily, we were sent here by our friends at the water ramp (acrobatix). The coffee is very good, the staff are amazingly friendly and pleased to serve you and there are lovely chairs on the porch that allow you to relax as you drink your coffee. The bakery is wonderful too (I have a gluten allergy so couldn&acute;t try but my husband loved it).\\nGo here for coffee and spend a moment looking in the shop, A wonderful way to spend you morning. One of my bucket list items was an outdoor concert with friends and a famous artist. A trip to Quebec and Festival d&acute;ete (summer festival) gave me the opportunity. The festival attracts many fampis names such as Carley Rae Jepson, Guns and Roses, Marianas Trench. We saw some of these but the best was Stevie Wonder.

He invited us on a short tour of the lower level afterwards (on his way to his break to smoke outside!) and gave us lots of great details about how the building was used hundreds of years ago. He also was happy to take group pictures of my wife and me and for two other groups--one of the best waiters I have had in some time (I would say this about several of our waiters in QC). The good was good, though not particularly remarkable--though my wife really loved their salad dressing. We enjoyed two of their house draft brews, which were cheaper than the other draughts on their menu. We had fun and happily have a pint there again. A pleasant walk from the centre, the gallery has a range of galleries covering mainly Canadian, including inuit, art. Impressive falls that you can do a circular trip round using cable car , bridges footpath and steps. Features a lot in canadian paintings. Very nice to spend a couple of days in. Very well maintained old lower town and more monumental upper town. Plenty of museums, etc but very much a place for wandering round. Worth taking the ferry across the river to view from the other side. We gave this a less than average rating primarily because of the food. The bison burger was over cooked as really dry, the fries were dry as well and the pork fillet was ok. We ate dinner here and the patio was full but most patrons were drinking or eating fries, so I figured it should not have been too busy in the kitchen to have a better cooked meal. The overall appearance of the pub was pretty clean and the waitress was friendly.',\n",
              " 'It&acute;s hard to ignore the majesty of this structure especially when contrasted against a deep blue Icelandic sky. We didn&acute;t get to go up to the top of the tower but it&acute;s on the list for next time.\\n\\nHaving visited many of the great cathedrals of Europe, I felt the interior to be sparse even by Scandinavian standards. There were a lot of tourists snapping photos and not really a lot to photograph inside.\\n\\nBe sure to view the building from different locations. The back is as interesting as the front and you&acute;ll find that the rear of the church adds a classical element to contrast the geometric minimalism of the basalt styled front. This place is amazing. It&acute;s interesting on the outside but when we ducked inside to get out of the wind, we discovered that it&acute;s far more special on the inside. One could easily spend and hour or more walking around photographing this place.\\n\\nThe architecture is a visual treat and when you add in the fact that it has a cafe and a couple of shops to browse, something as seemingly mundane as a convention center becomes a worthwhile tourist attraction. Go see it! get a guided tour or simply admire the architecture and the color (glass facede, basalt floors etc). What a fantastic location. Used Reykjavik Excursions to go on their Southern Coast tour. Having been the Golden Circle tour two days earlier we expected to be disappointed. We couldn&acute;t have been more wrong. This was an excellent tour, with great guide and driver. There was so much to see and do we wanted it to last longer. It was great value value on a luxury coah. Highly recommended. Visited for lunch which was truly superb and reasonably priced. Interesting modern building to look around Visited Videy Island by chance and found the peace monument there. A short ferry ride to this unspoilt place and spend a few hours wandering around exploring. Lovely cafe for refreshments and a lot of local history to enjoy with superb views and scenery Well worth a visit but pay the extra to go up the bell tower for an impressive 360 degree view of the city. Although this is a modern church it is very interesting inside and the history of it is fascinating. There is a small garden with a collection of bronze statues adjacent to the church which are worth a visit. Recommended We went on this tour with David yesterday and it was absolutely brilliant. David is extremely knowledgeable and has a great friendly way of passing the information on to you. The pick up was bang on time and the day&acute;s schedule was perfect with several short stops as well as the 3 main sites we visited. All are equally fascinating in their own way. The bus (20 seater) was spotless and very comfortable. I would thoroughly recommend this tour and in particular this company. Thanks for a great day My wife and I participated in the city walk yesterday, our first and only day in Iceland on our trip. We are so glad we found this as we learned a lot about this remarkable city. We had not previously signed up for the walk, but were directed to it by the tourist information center about 10 minute before it started. I would recommend pre-registering as the walk is limited to 30-35 persons. Fortunately, we were allowed to join the group.\\n\\nThe tour guides, Erik and Magnus, were excellent. Erik was lively and passionate about the city and his country. He was a history major and his knowledge was vast. He spoke about history, the economy, the politics, the culture and the future of Iceland. He encouraged questions, has an infectious, but serious, personality and was very engaging. Magnus was a bit more laid back, but also very knowledgeable and friendly. The tour starts at a little park next to the parliament building, crosses up to the area where the first settlers in Reykjavik lived, and wends its way near the harbor, up the hill to the Viking monument, crosses over the to a high school, and ends at the lake next to the city hall - about 2 hours in length, maybe a mile or mile and a half in distance. There is no cost, but tips are encouraged.\\n\\nThe tour was fun and very informative. We only had one day to spend in Iceland and wish it had been 4-5 days more. After the city walk, one cannot help but wanting to return to this charming city and country.',\n",
              " 'Fui conhecer o Theatro Municipal em uma visita guiada e tive uma tarde bem cultural. Os guias sГЈo preparados e explicam a histГіria, a arquitetura e as reformas que o Municipal jГЎ passou. Se vocГЄ tiver sorte, pode apreciar o ensaio de algum espetaculo que esteja acontencendo no Teatro. I saw Sugarloaf from Copacabana beach every day of my holiday and so wanted to see it up close. Using a tour was a good idea as you get to &acute;fast-track&acute; the queues for the cable cars, although the queues seemed to be moving quickly. You approach Sugarloaf in two parts, firstly a cable car to Morro da Urca where you can see some of the original cable cars and grab a drink form the cafe, and then the second cable car to the top.\\n\\nThe views are amazing in every direction: you can see Christ the Redeemer, the long stretch of Copacabana beach, as well as many others. Some people even arrived by helicopter!\\n\\nIt&acute;s certainly a magnificent place to visit and I imagine even more spectacular for sunset. It dominates the skyline and is just as impressive close up.\\n\\nThere are a number of ways to get here: car, taxi, train or by tour. I went by tour and would recommend it as it means you get right to the entrance and then are &acute;fast tracked&acute; through the queues. This is great as if you don&acute;t get there early you can be waiting a long time and there is no shade (the temperature was 40&acute;C on the day we visited). However, if you do decide to make it up there yourself then there are lots of vendors selling umbrellas and water, or you could just bring your own umbrella to hide from the sun. The other advantage of taking a tour or taxi is that there is very limited parking and you may have to park your car further down the slope and walk the rest of the way up the steep incline.\\n\\nOnce there and up close, the views are spectacular! And there&acute;s plenty of opportunity to take pictures of the famous monument. There are also lots of tourist shops, cafes and toilet facilities. It is most definitely a must visit destination. Fui ao Cristo Redentor via Trem do Corcovado. Ingressos comprados com pouca antecedГЄncia, de forma muito fГЎcil, via internet. Tudo funcionou perfeitamente e no horГЎrio correto. O passeio de trem Г© bem agradГЎvel, apesar do calor de 30ВєC. Chegando lГЎ em cima, em um sГЎbado, encontrei o lugar absolutamente lotado, mas tambГ©m oferecendo a mais linda vista da cidade. Minha Гєnica dica fica para o horГЎrio da visita. Fui Г\\xa0 tarde, e encontrei o Sol Г\\xa0s costas do Cristo, o que dificultou um pouco as fotos. This is truly the nicest place in Rio what I have seen. It statue is monumental and breathtaking. Lots of people will be around, but still you can enjoy that new wonder of the world. A must see in Rio. Very well organized place. You pay 53 rials and the train will take you to a really nice place. Go-go-go! We came to Rio for four days. On the first day (on the day of our arrival) we scheduled a tour with these guys. Luciana was talking us for the tour. It took cca. 3 hours and it was really well designed. Not too much, not too little and it was interesting. The organization is also perfect. We had to move the tour one day ahead (after the reservation was done) and they moved it with no problem. The only thing you should pay attention to is to take the morning tour if you have the chance, since in case of the afternoon tour some place might be closed.\\n\\nOverall: go! Spectacular view of Rio from the top of Dois Irm?os (Two Brothers) Mountain after a 50 minute walk up by Vidigal. Mandatory.',\n",
              " 'Somehow it lost something when I went inside. From a monumental historic amazing surviving structure, to just another basillica. Still breath taking, and containing the same 60,000 people it always has. . . Too many people, too liittle to be seen. The piazza is worth a walk through, if it happens to be on your route elsewhere. The nighttime scene was pulsating. A wonderful walkthrough. Definitely pay for the earphones to hear a history of the paintings or you will just walk through the villa in 30 minutes and not know any of the back story. Never heard of Cavaggio till I came here. I studied Latin in high school. How could I not have gotten excited to see what I had read about or learned about when I was younger. It was so exciting to see the Colosseum and ruins. I am not kidding I took probably 300 photos at these 3 sights alone. Worth every penny. Our 2014 Christmas card was a photo of us in front of the Colosseum. It is like my dream card. If I ever return to Italy, I will return here at 1 am for night time photos and 6 am for daylight. We could not get good photos.It was ridiculously crowded and full of students and pestering hawkers. We went in April so no construction. It was beautiful, but just way too many people. One must book this place and make reservations in advance! I called 2 weeks before our trip. LOL my first long distance overseas phone call ever.\\n\\nThe villa itself is very elaborate and even gaudy, but when you focus in on the wonderful works of art, there is a lot to learn. I did not do the tour, but did the audioguide, which was very interesting. I have a 6 year old so I was not able to hire tour guides and do audioguides as much as I wanted to at all the sights we went to in Rome, but for this place I made sure to! I made my son and husband sit in one of the parlors and wait for me as I could hear about Cardinal Scipione Borghese and the artists, Bernini, Canova, etc along with their respective pieces of art.\\n\\nLoved, loved the sculpture of Apollo and Daphne by Bernini and was amazed that Titian&acute;s \"Sacred and Profane\" painting was worth equivalent $15 million back in the 1800s when someone wanted to purchase it. More than the house, grounds, and entire art collection. Well, this was according to the audio guide. I was awestruck.\\n\\nUnfortunately, you cannot take photos here. So I used up most of the allotted 2 hours and admired by brains out. I did take photos of the gardens outside the gallery. The experience was heavenly compared to Vatican museum where we were pushed and shoved. Here because of the reservation and timed entrance system, you are at total peace! And no huge groups of tour groups or students hogging up the space! However, we did the touristy thing and ate at the nearby Hard Rock Cafe, which was swarmed by tourists galore! But it is a fun place to hang out for children and buy the requisite overpriced shirts.\\n\\nSad to see that Via Veneto is no longer the vogue place it used to be when stars would hang out at the restaurants and hotels here, but this would be a lovely area to rent an apartment, especially for families since the park is close by and children can have fun there. This along with the Empire State building, Abraham Lincoln Memorial, Eiffel Tower, Pyramids, etc is one of the must see structures of the world. While the inside is sort of ugly, I love, love, love the exterior. I remember going to a Mc Donald&acute;s at home here in the States and I saw a poster for kids showing an app for traveling and it had a picture of the Colosseum. It should be on every person&acute;s bucket list because how many movies have we seen with it or showing gladiator type or Roman empire movies?\\n\\nWe went twice. Once to look at it from the outside and to wait so I could play with my camera and get night time shots. The negative thing is as we were admiring the views and people watching, the pesky vendors kept harassing us. You can not just sit there in peace without them bugging you! Very annoying that my husband lost his temper for a second to a guy who would not take no for an answer! It was also amusing to see the security \"try\" to chase the vendors away, but were never successful.We also ate at a restaurant nearby waiting for the sun to go down with a view of the Colosseum. How cool is that? I never ate with a view of anything in my life, but my next to do would be to eat at a place with a view of the Eiffel Tower. 15 years ago I was too cheap to do that when we went to Paris, lol. Then we came back a 2nd time to go inside the Colosseum.\\n\\nIt is hell to take the B line from Termini to the Colosseo. So crowded on the subways! We went in the late afternoon. Yes, it is crowded at the Colosseo outside in the late afternoon, but first we went to the Roman Fourm/Palatine Hill area around 3 pm. We walked around in the late and hot afternoon for 2 hours, and then went to the Colosseo around 5 pm. There&acute;s not much to see inside the Colosseum. It&acute;s pretty unappealing, but still an awesome sight to behold and imagine what it looked like with the gladiators and later tenements in the past. We sat there till closing. By 5 pm it was the perfect time to take pictures and mill about because there were not too many tourists/students. I believe they close at 7 pm.\\n\\nSo the worst time to go to the Colosseum would be from morning to afternoon. We first went to get our tickets at the Roman Forum/Palatine Hill ticket booth around 2-3 pm. No line whatsoever. There were a lot of students here, but the grounds are so expansive that there is room for everybody! There is so much for everyone to explore in this area. Kids could have a ball going up and down and around structures. You could spend 5 hours on the grounds looking at the ancient ruins. I cannot imagine what summer here is like. Miserable. We went here in April and it was low 70s and already hot with the mid day sun! So I would suggest one see the Forum/Palatine area first in the afternoon and then see the Colosseum later in the late afternoon as we did.\\n\\nOne day when my son is older, we will return and I will get the full on guided tours of both this and the Roman Forum. Pre-teens and teens will be able to sync the tours and historical tidbits with their world history class and appreciate it more. A lot of great history in Rome and I plan to come back! This trip was more for me and enjoying Europe as we had been doing just beach and Disney World trips for the last 5 years for my young son! My son has been to Disney World vacations 5 times already, and I am done with them! I don&acute;t know. It was quaint, but maybe we did not walk the entire district. I wanted to see more laundry hanging out of the windows. Doesn&acute;t seem as authentically local Italian as I thought it would be. I think a lot of expats and well to do people have moved into the area along with tourists renting apartments. I was expecting lower to middle class Italians out and about and like I mentioned loads of clothes hanging from balconies the way I have seen in videos and photos. I did not see this. It looks sort of like what Old Town Alexandria in Virginia looks like, a mix of touristy cafes and well to do residents living there. I know it was the middle of the day, but I was expecting a more middle class village. NOT. A lot of tourists like me walking along with the gelato shops and Bangladesh street vendors hawking their wares. I was sort of teed off because we spent 2 hours walking from the Vatican area looking for this place and getting lost! But they do have cheap tourist cafes to rest and eat from! After spending 2 hours walking from St. Peter&acute;s along the Tiber River looking for Trastevere district, we finally found it. We sort of took the walk recommended by Rick Steves in his book and ended up at this church along with its Piazza. It was a hot day and students and tourists were sitting at the fountain in the Piazza. We went inside to cool off and admire this pretty church. Wish I had read up on the history, so it was basically a pretty little church. Too tired to read about it in my tour book! Since this church was destroyed and rebuilt due to a fire in the 1800s, it&acute;s relatively new compared to the others. I loved taking the subway here. It was a quick walk right out of the subway stop, just like the Colosseum subway stop. So convenient. Also a McDonald&acute;s right there for a rest area stop before and after going to church as well as a quick lunch. We got tired of eating pasta and pizza every day.\\n\\nWe were delighted that this church was relatively massive tourist/throngs free! So nice to walk around in peace without the chatter and distraction of the masses like at St. Peter&acute;s Basilica or the pushing and shoving at the Vatican Museum! We spent 2.5 to 3 hours here! I wish we had just paid the 4 euro per head to go into the cloister, a separate part of the church.\\n\\nLovely church with portraits of every Pope lining the ceilings as well as a peek of St. Paul&acute;s sarcophagus beneath the altar. Also lovely grounds surrounding the church as well as the garden in the front of the church. Would be blessed and happy to return to this church. I wish I had read up on the history of this place, but did not. It was basically a sooty looking exterior and wide space with an open hole in the dome, which was cool. Wish I had taken photos of the drainage vents. The thing that ruined it were the massive throngs of people in early April! Just felt so stifling, hence the 3 star review. Could have appreciated more had I read up on the background and without the crowds. It was even worse outside in the piazza. We only spent 15 minutes sitting inside for a sit down break after 2 hours walking looking for this place along with Piazza Navonna! Nice spot, but the best time would be to come at freaking 6 am away from the masses. There are a lot of school children and too many crap vendors harassing you so it&acute;s not a sublime experience like it might have been back in the day. Now it&acute;s like Times Square. I can&acute;t cook worth two cents so places like this and Whole Foods in the States do not impress me. We rented an apartment near the Vatican, and went here to buy eggs, veggies, meats, breads, etc. We tried to buy eggs from one vendor, but he said he didn&acute;t have change for 20 euros?!? Most Italian people looked uncomfortable or cautious because we did not speak a lick of Italian nor did they speak English since most tourists don&acute;t come here. The only vendors who were at ease and not stiff were the Indian/Bangladeshi vendors since they understood us. We spent 30 euros on groceries. Hello, that is a whole lot just for eggs, milk, strawberries, mushrooms, potatoes, bacon, and bread! $45? Come on. For the rest of the trip we went to a Conad supermarket 3 to 5 times! Talk about annoying. If you are here for one of those tour of Italy or Europe with 2-3 days in Rome, and just have to come here as all tourists do because it&acute;s a must do, then this place will leave a bad taste in your mouth and make you never want to return to Roma. They are doing construction on the fountain at the bottom so place looks even more ugly along with the massive swarms of tourists going up and down the stairs, sitting on the stairs, and hogging up the streets of the designer shops in the area. Its like Times Square in New York on New Year&acute;s Eve. Come on, and it was raining also! I guess to really enjoy the beauty of the Steps, one would have to come at 5 am. I might return here tomorrow, Monday, hoping all the weekend European tourists are gone! Truely exceptional guide services by Max and Massimo. Go to the front of the line, detailed discussions about the attractions, prompt service, tour guides are working together to enrich your experience, and the security guards know and like your guide. I highly recommend this 5 star service! RomeInLimo is an excellent company. Our first trip to Rome and we met Enrico, who was a true gentlemen and above all showed us the highlights and met our quirky requests (yes, we even went to the Europa2 mall in Rome). Ages in our group are 84, 75, 54, 53, and 11. And yes, Enrico made sure that all were taken care of, from refrigerated water inside the refrigerator in the beautiful van, to making sure we saw the Colosseum early in the morning to help the older members of our group. He dropped us off where it was easier to walk to the various places of interest and picked us up on time. He even gave us his cell phone to call him if our prearranged time wasn&acute;t quick enough! Truly incredible and we felt we were in extremely good hands. He took the stress out of what we wanted to see so we could actually enjoy the surroundings. He also talked at great length with my elderly father-in-law who asked a myriad of questions, political, economic, etc. It was great fun and if we ever get the chance to be back in Italy, we will definitely request Enrico and certainly secure RomeInLimo. It is a company that delivers the highest quality tours and Enrico was the best! He was great fun! We actually didn&acute;t know what this was - just looked very grand! There is a great series of exhibitions inside but if you only do one thing climb the stairs to the viewing platform or take the lift to the very top for six euro and see all of Rome. Also great cafe! I loved this museum. I daughter had sent us on a mission to view the real bronze statue of Marcus Aurelius. It is a must see housed in a modern Museum. There are a series of intimate rooms with excellant narratives. Great roof top cafe as well with views across the city. Late afternoon espresso was taken here! Easy walk and amazing sculpures. It is best light for photos later in the day and is quite a different piazza from the Pantheon The scale and the volume of the building. The lift was out and stairs can be tough if elderly or frail. Check if the lift is working before you go. Research the story of Marcus Aurelius first and go and see the real thing in the Museum Again something to visit at different times of the day to get different light on your pictures. At night they turn the lights on which is pretty. It is so hectic but everyone sort of moves through and it is not hard to get some great photos An easy stroll from the hotel. Go and see at different times of the day and night, lots of coffee shops to stop and gaze from. Consider the engineering, and that they stole material to build the Vatican The Colosseum,I believe was originally called the Flavian Amphitheatre, is a must to visit when in Rome. We visited on 30/12/2012, thinking we&acute;d avoid the crowds, but so popular and even at this off season time, many, many making this journey to see the structure and surrounds. This massive amphitheater in the centre of the city of Rome, is the largest ever built in the Roman Empire. Constructed from concrete and stone this icon is considered one of the greatest works of Roman architecture and Roman engineering. Don&acute;t miss it. Suggest if you can get tickets that avoid you needing to queue. We purchased tickets with Green Line Tours (with guide in a group) and avoided the 100&acute;s of people queuing to get through the entrance points. If your a photographer, don&acute;t miss this opportunity to snap away. Morning of 9 January my partner and I decided to recap our Rome sight seeing with the hop on hop off Green Line tour by bus around Rome. We were approached at the train station Roma Termini by guide/salesperson offering day ticket for 18 EUR. We decided to take the offer, so the guide / salesperson took us to the nearby Green Line office where we purchased daily ticket. We then proceeded to the nearby stop at Roma Termini where we could board the bus. There were about 20 people waiting to board with us, mixed nationalities, not all speaking English. A large group were ahead and behind me and my partner. All were conversing loudly like my partner and I were invisible! Perhaps excited for their forthcoming bus trip... I am unsure. As time came to board there were two from this group ahead of us who entered the bus. Plenty of space on the bus. The buses also depart every 20 mins. The persons in front began to converse with the tour operator checking people onto the bus and hand over their boarding passes. Conversation followed with the two in front of us for some minutes. My partner and I could not understand what was being discussed, again spoken in Spanish or Italian. Then for no apparent reason the people behind us began pushing and trying to enter the bus. The two people ahead of my partner and I began waving to the group behind us to get on the bus. About 10 people pushed around us entering the bus. The tour operator did nothing to speak to my partner and I. The action by this group then started to send the remainder of people waiting into a boarding frenzy! My partner and I were next to board so we entered the bus with the rest of the group pushing us forward or trying to get around us. We asked the tour operator why he allowed others to board ahead and complained about the behaviour of the group around us. He said nothing. He was smiling as if to say \"bad luck\". We boarded the bus and took a seat. The remainder of passengers got on and seated themselves.\\n\\nThe bus tour uses headsets in multiple languages. Several of the headset jacks we tried did not work and we needed to move seats.\\n\\nAt one of the stops the tour ticket operator got off the bus for what appeared to be a short break where he proceeded to light up a cigarette and begin smoking. The two people who were ahead of my partner and I initially in the queue saw the operator smoking and decided to dismount the bus and join him on the sidewalk. One they were all finished their cigarettes they got back on the bus and we continued around the streets of Rome.\\n\\nWe took a similar tour in the same week in Milan. Green Line organisation was really unprofessional in comparison to the Milan operators of the red hop on hop off buses. Green Line tour operators on this bus we had entered showed little regard to informing passengers of stops or to regulating people getting on the bus. Shambles.\\n\\nReally unprofessional. I would not return to use this service, nor would I recommend it to others. We do not usually do tours, and certainly not ones like this, but we were time poor in Rome. The tour was fabulous and our guide, Luca, was pleasant, knowledgeable, enthusiastic and good fun. We could not possibly have seen all the sites we visited by ourselves in the same time (avoiding the queues was great). The amount we learnt about Roman and Italian history was also great. In the Roman Forum and Vatican Museums in particular, it is overwhelming seeing the number of things to see. Luca was able to direct us to the most important and impressive. We had initially booked a tour for the evening, but Rex Tours contacted us saying that since the temperature was going to drop, we could take an earlier tour if we wanted to. We are thankful that we made the switch since it did get quite cold as the sun went down.\\n\\nWe have taken segway tours all over the world and this was by far the best we have ever taken. The equipment was first class, the batteries were fully charged, and the tour guide did a great job of giving us good information about the sites we visited. On many segway tours, there is a lot of time wasted just standing around and very little riding time. That was not the case with Rex Tours. Of the 3 1/2 hours, we probably spent 3 hours whizzing around the city on segways. We were surprised just how fast they would go!\\n\\nFor those who are hesitant to consider riding a segway - hesitate no longer. They are wonderful intuitive machines, the training given is excellent and the quality of the equipment is excellent.\\n\\nAfter the tour, when we mentioned where we were going to dinner (Angolo Divino - also excellent), the tour guide walked us over to the restaurant and introduced us to the owner.\\n\\nWe will do this tour again the next time we are in Rome. We saw La Traviata in this lovely and atmospheric theatre and the couple of hours just passed by in a magical haze.\\n\\nThe staff in this theatre are simply charming and we wish we would have been hungry to enjoy the complimentary pasta, as it smelt wonderful, but we did partake of the \"Gelato\" which was everything Italian gelato should be.\\n\\nAs for the performances ...each and every member of the production was fantastic with a marvellous orchestra - but i must single out one person.....the conductor.\\nWe sat three rows from the front and he totally mesmerized me, as he knew every single word and nuance of the score and didnt follow a single sheet of music.\\n\\nThis was our first night in Rome and it really could not have been better. I love this basilica and it is so close to everything! Make sure to make it a part of your itinerary in Rome. Just amazing to be there and see the tomb and chains of St Paul... I have been there before but I couldn&acute;t resist going back.',\n",
              " 'Fantastic atmosphere to walk around the old town and soak in the coffee houses and museums. Definitely one of my favourite cities and worth a visit. Fantastic gardens and great views in the centre of the city. Worth a visit and free of charge to walk around the gardens and see the Sound of Music fountain. Really enjoyed the show at this unique marionette theatre. I didn&acute;t really know what to expect but it is very well presented and highly amusing so an entertaining evening. Worth a visit if in the area. I give this tour a 4 star, basically averaged between the salt mine and the sound of music. The Salt mine being 5 star. The minivan driver was great and the actual tour was fantastic. The tour was a great break from endless churches, castles, etc. It was enjoyable and a little bit educational, it was fun. The driver/guide was unlike the two on the big bus of Sound of Music. His script was his own and seems to be really knowledgable. Although I found that the trip going to the salt mine was really long, scenery was good though, but coming back it seemed really a short trip. The driver was really surprised to get a tip although he really deserved it as there were only 6 people in the minivan, almost a private tour. Really enjoyable for the salt mine, . (That slide was the highlight.)unfortunately I can not say the same for the Sound of Music Tour.\\n\\nThe 2nd tour, I give 3 star, The Sound of Music was just a re-telling of the tape recording by Liesl, the oldest daughter in the original cast. I felt like the information was handed to them and did not make any effort to do their bit. I felt ripped off especially when the driver and the guide were so keen on getting tips from the tourists. Sure they drove us to the places, which you can get to by metro for $2.50 or free if you have a Salzburg card. The musicians were outstanding. Vocals were fantastic. Venue was great , Decorations truly exceptional, costume was really amazing. The food? Less than average. Could hardly eat them, the ice cream saved the day. So do not expect much in terms of food. The chicken soup was like salt soup, very salty and the chicken dumpling was yuck. I don&acute;t remember the mains as we went in April, but none on our table had half the dish. Also somehow, I felt that it was not on a first come first served basis as they seem to group the asians together? All these years and still looks like the view from the movies. At least from the distance. So well preserved. This is truly a great place. The view of the whole city is just beautiful. If you are in Salzburg, you have to come here, and stay a short while. There is a bit of walking. You can get the funicular ride on the way up and then go see some of the rooms and stop to take some pictures and then just enjoy the views and walk down again. Beautiful place. We travelled in April, start of spring. Oh everything was in bloom. The garden was truly beautiful. It was raining when we went there. So it was not that busy, and it was good because we were able be there without much queues. But the umbrella could be a hindrance. I love every aspect of this garden. Must see when in Salzburg. Went there in April. Still have some snow. Not so much walking happening as snow was melting, but manageable. The view was outstanding though. If you have a Salzburg card, the travel on the tram to get to this place is free and the lift is free also. Delightful old town. Everything was just around the corner. Great view from the Fortress. There are lots of eateries and little cafes. Nice cathedral. Love the Mozartplace and all the little shops. However there seems a few begging gypsies around the area.',\n",
              " 'You can easily spend a whole day aboard the The USS Midway without getting bored. The attention to detail, well laid out experience and highly skilled staff makes this a truly rememberable experience. I would say 3 hours is minimum, although there is no way one can digest the vastness of this iconic vessel in that time. The museum sits right in the San Diego harbour, with excellent on-site (paid) parking. The kids (6 and 10) totally loved it. If you visit one place when in San Diego make sure you spend time on the USS Midway. This massive aircraft carrier has things of interest for all the family, both young and old. The entrance fee is very reasonable, car park access good and many ex military staff on hand to provide informative and helpful details on all the exhibits on show.\\nI really can&acute;t recommend a visit highly enough and be sure to take your camera! An excellent place to spend a day whether visiting the museums, strolling around the artists village, checking out the zoo or just having a family day out and picnic in the park, this is a place to visit. Be aware that the museums charge and if you have a family this might work out expensive should you visit all the museums on offer. Excellent place to visit. Extremely interesting for all ages with a great deal to see. Interactive exhibits of planes, helicopters, captain&acute;s flight deck etc. Parking available and whole visit very well organised by the US navy. Don&acute;t miss out this is a great place to go for a few hours Nice zoo, but I have expected more. The pandas are cool and it is nicely organized, but it was only opened until 6pm. The captain greets you with a quick safety message before boarding this ungainly-looking vehicle. The seating is comfortable and the view is fantastic as you roll along the streets of San Diego near the bay. Then you go down a lunch ramp into the bay and glide along, all the while learning about the history and geography of the area from the well-informed and humorous first mate. A close encounter with sea lions and birds is guaranteed. Other sight may include racing yachts, cruise ships, Navy vessels (including submarines), or dolphins. Back up the ramp and a short drive to the disembarking location at Seaport Village. Well worth the time and money. I had never ridden a SEGWAY PT before, but had always wanted to since I first saw one years ago. It was completely intuitive. After a few mintes of instruction, I was riding easily and smoothly almost immediately. Bridgette was our tour guide through Balboa Park. I&acute;m a local, but she did teach me a few things I didn&acute;t know. And although there was one woman in our tour who was nervous about handling the segway, Bridgette helped her all along the way until the woman was finally comfortable riding near the end of our tour. Kudos to Bridgette and her unending patience. SeaWorld gets the dolphins they train from Japanese dolphin killers. See the documentary film \"The Cove\" for more information. I continue to boycott SeaWorld until they change their practice. This theater company is loud and proud of the San Diego gay community. They often perform original plays adapted from old standards, adding gay/lesbian elements that permeate the performance. Often hilarious, often thought provoking, always getting thier message of equality and liberty to anyone who will listen. Many of the shows are musicals. Very talented performers. With their tiny stage and crowded seating plan, you are always close to the action. There&acute;s just too much to review. I&acute;m a member of the zoological society, and visit quite often. If you spend all day, you&acute;ll never see it all. So if you are going to see only certain parts of teh zoo, I recommend you don&acute;t miss the orangutans, the hippo pool, elephant odyssey and the polar bear plunge. There&acute;s also a new bug zoo in the children&acute;s section which gets you up close to various insects and arachnids. An exhibit near the hippo pool combines monkeys, otters, and cattle. Back in the old days when lighthouse keepers were people, not computer programs, a family was living in each of the hundreds of lighthouses in the U.S. This one is preserved the way it was when it was abandoned and replaced by a new lighthouse more than a hundred years ago. You can go up the spiral staircase and see the 3 levels, but the top lever (where the light is located) is open only 2 days every year. Best viewed from below on a boat. Driving across it is, well, like driving on a bridge. Start your visit by checking out the short historical films in the theater. Did you know that San Diego Bay was discovered by the Spanish 60 years before the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock? Learn about everything from the native population and plants life to Point Loma as a defensive fortress during WWII. Take in the stunning views from the patio next to the gift shop. Make your way up the winding spiral staircase in the old lighthouse, and learn why it was abandoned more than a hundred years ago. Visit a couple of gun emplacements (sans guns) and lookout bunkers. A short walk to the ocean overlook where you may see gray whales migrating from December thru March. Don&acute;t drive away without first going down the hill to the tidepools. Take off your shoes, roll up your trousers, and wade around among the many creatures left behind when the tide went out. Of course it&acute;s best to check a tide calendar, and try to arrive at or near the low tide for that day. Among the more common anemones and limpets, you can find baby lobsters, sea hares, sea cucumbers, garibaldi, and octopi. The only thing I didn&acute;t like about the place was the closing time. They close at 5PM every day, even on long summer days. If you have any nautical blood in your veins, this is definitely a must-see and do place during your visit to San Diego. I&acute;ve been a member of this museum since I moved to San Diego in 1998. They have the finest collection of operational historic ships and replicas in the world. This includes &acute;Star of India&acute;, the world&acute;s oldest fully active ship, and &acute;Surprise&acute;, featured in the film \"Master and Commander\". A replica of &acute;San Salvador&acute; is currently under construction and should be sailing within 2 years. You can visit the construction site at no additional charge. &acute;San Salvador&acute; was Cabrillo&acute;s flagship when he discovered San Diego Bay in 1542. Also active and available for you to sail are &acute;Californian&acute;, the state&acute;s official tallship; and &acute;Pilot&acute;, the world&acute;s hardest working boat, built in San Diego in 1914. Lots of ship models including a large display of Navy ship models. Also based here are the America&acute;s Cup yachts &acute;Star&acute;s & Stripes&acute; and &acute;Abracadabra&acute;, as well as the replica yacht &acute;America&acute;. Unless you are looking for a souvenir with \"San Diego\" printed on it or want an overpriced meal, I recommend skipping this tourist trap altogether. The only redeeming feature is sometimes they have good live music in the gazebo during the summer. Every Sunday afternoon the San Diego Civic Organist performs a free concert for anyone who happens by. The amphitheater seats around 2000 people, and there is room for another 1000 to bring your own chair. The real beauty of this place comes out on Monday nights during the summer, when additional organ concerts are scheduled under the lights. Also during summer on Tue/Wed/Thu afternoons, there are free concerts of every kind of music, from military bands to rock&acute;n&acute;roll to bluegrass. If you sit on one of the hard steel benches, I recommend you bring your own cushion. I have been to the USS Midway every year since it opened. Every time I visit, there are more areas open to see than the year before. This shows the dedication and hard work of the volunteers and docents who love this place. Many of the docents actually served aboard this ship when she was in active duty, and can tell you some amazing stories. Don&acute;t be afraid to ask them questions, they love it when you do. Don&acute;t be in a hurry. You won&acute;t see the whole thing in an hour or two. If you follow the recommended tour and listen to all the additional audio bits on the portable sound system, you can easily spend 4 hours and still not see and hear everything. I&acute;d lived in San Diego 15 years before visiting the Model Railroad Museum. I should not haver waited. They&acute;ve got every model scale on display, including three-rail and LEGOВ® displays. The newest display is already operational while still under construction, and spans 3 levels on 2 stories. The detail of construction in every display is amazing. Not only trains, but whole towns including people, cars, pets, plants, EVERYTHING. To top it off, San Diego residents can visit FREE once each month. The sleight of hand, mind games, and prop tricks are all wondrous. You will be amazed and confused by what you think you are seeing. These guys are some of the best illusionists I&acute;ve ever seen.\\n\\nBUT. This \"theater\" is little more than a small conference room with about 30 folding metal chairs. There is no raised platform or stage. There are no risers for audience seating. Therefore if you are not in the first row, you have to rely on the TV monitor so see what is going on. CCTV has about one second delay, making it a bit confusing when viewing the card tricks and other close-up magic. I felt I might as well be at home watching it on TV.\\n\\nOverall I felt it was not worth the $20 ticket price, simply because the venue was so unsuitable. Some couples said they got in for $30 for the pair, so I supose you can find that deal somewhere online. If they could find a place more suitable to the performance or alter their existing venue, I would go again.\\n\\nNot recommended for small children. I&acute;ve been to several shows at this quaint little theater located in Old Town San Diego. Every performance has been better than the previous one. Very professional, extremely entertaining, always worth the ticket price. But the secret is you can get half price tickets by calling and saying you are returning to see the show again. You can also get half price by booking through GoldStar. Their repertoire includes comedies, musicals, and heavy dramas. The theater is only 9 rows deep, with a very steep rise between rows, so even if a very tall person wearing a hat were sitting in front of you, your view would not be obstructed. The seating is arranged in a semi-circle around the stage, and there are no bad seats in the house. The lobby is small and crowded, but there is plenty of space outside on the patio for intermission. \"America\" is probably the finest sailing yacht in charter service anywhere. The immaculate teak decks and varnished doghouses really stand out among the ships docked at the Maritime Museum. The crew mad me feel welcome, and really made my trip a memorable experience. We got up close and personal to several whales and dozens of dolphins. The captain was careful to keep a safe distance while getting us close enough for some good photographs. We learned a lot about the migration and mating habits of Gray Whales. The crew served hot chocolate just as I was starting to get chilled on the way back to the harbor. A 100% positive experience.',\n",
              " 'Had a great time watching the game and overlooking the bay! Huge variety of food choices-first time us New Yorker&acute;s ever saw a backpack full of hot chocolate being dispensed at a game! We thought they were joking, but if you want a bag for any of your pro-shop purchases, it&acute;ll cost you a quarter...yet another great idea to reduce paper usage! Worth a visit albeit kids may get bored. I expected more Japanese theme than we saw but overall, worth a visit if in GoldenGate Park. Gotta do the tea for sure with the mini pastries. Summary: great food but not that many choices; expensive but what a view; excellent service. Lots of history to the place which is worth reading about while there. Its close to the western entrance to the Golden gate park. Overally, a local institution worth visiting while there especially if you have a car. I came across this accidently while on Yelp or some other site. This is definitely the tour to do and well worth the extra 30minutes on the boat. There is indoor and outdoor sitting and it takes you very close to alcatraz and around it, as well as under both bridges and along the entire bay. They give you audio sets with headphones so you can choose not to listen to the narration if you dont want to. Well worth the price. Another must see while in SanFran, Expansive view of city and both bridges. Parking may be a minor issue but waiting for one is definitely worth what you see afterwards These little cars are really fun! Also, hilarious (you are riding around in full-size traffic in a little motorbike slash golfcart thing, in a helmet). I didn&acute;t drive the car myself, but my husband said it was pretty easy to maneuver. It&acute;s a little hairy when you&acute;re navigating in the heart of the city, but the \"tour\" we did had some straightaways along the embarcadero that were fine. For the most part, the gocars seem to be a novelty so drivers give you the right of way, but you have to be careful. The major drawbacks of the experience for me were:\\n1. TRAFFIC. We booked an hour tour that took you through the city down to the piers on the embarcadero. We were actively moving for maybe 10 minutes and the whole rest of the time sitting in stopped traffic. We had to cut our tour short and just return to the starting point so we wouldn&acute;t be charged for hours on end (we wound up paying for 1.5 hours and didn&acute;t see much of the tour). I know there isn&acute;t much to be done about traffic but some guidance from the men at the office would have been helpful. Sitting in the blinding heat with no cover, as 8million tourists stare at you (and take your picture!) got old pretty fast.\\n\\n2) The men working in the office that we rented from were not particularly helpful. We didn&acute;t have a reservation (we saw these things driving on the road and immediately looked them up!), but they seemed a little annoyed at having walk-up business. The \"overview\" was a man pointing us to a portable DVD player while a video played. Then we got a brief walk-through when we got in the car. We were given a map with the tours on them, but really NO direction as to what would be a good route to take with one hour, during that time of day, etc. For a novelty experience that you can assume no one has ever done before, they left a lot to be desired in the customer service department.\\n\\nWe came back about 30 minutes late, and they tried to charge us for 2 hours, but revised it when I corrected him (check your bill before you&acute;re charged!). Definitely do this trip for a giggle and some fun at your own pace, but don&acute;t expect too much out of the GPS \"tour\" (the reception went in and out and we actually just used our google maps to get back to the starting point), or the customer service experience. It&acute;s a nice stroll around the ships and really not crowdy, the big sailship Alaskan Star is really nicely restored and you can really get a good feeling of how it was in those days when they had to import even glass windows and cement to SF... Turist heavy area with according prices. Definetly worth a walk through, but eating elsewhere is probably a good idea if you arenot into packed places. Everybody knows the Cable Cars, they are a trademark of SF! Since single ride is $6, better buy 1 day Visitor pass for Cable Car/Bus/Tram... for $15 or 3 day Visitor pass for $23. You can then enjoy whole SF area without incurring any additional costs for either Taxi or something else. Public transport is VERY EFFICIENT and waiting time is mostly minimal! Seeing a lot of Chinatowns already, this one was a bit disappointing. Most of the shops I saw were tourist oriented and the place didn&acute;t have this \"authentic\" feeling to it. But it might be, that I was just too early (at 10:00am most shops are still not open) and things change in afternoon...But definitely very good place to buy souvenirs and t-shirts and stuff are around $3 compared to >$10 elsewhere (and probably same ones). We booked the tickets in advance from official web site and visited the rock at 12:00. Purchasing tickets online saved us A LOT of time at the ticket office - no need to stand in line. After boarding the boat, quick jump over to the Island and here you are. A nice short introduction and instructions and off you are on your own!\\n\\nGreat photo opportunities and very nice audioguide will explain everything even if going on your own tour.\\n\\nWe had extra luck and one of ex Alcatraz Prisoners was present signing the book, so a bonus :)\\n\\nBring a cap and hoodie as it can be quite chilly in winter (especially on the boat). I am sure most of the visitors will place Golden Gate on top of their ToDo&acute;s and right so. Public transport is available with Bus 28 so no need for any special tour/taxi....I recommend early morning or late evening (sunset) time for good photos, otherwise you will probably get a bit of \"foggy\" look. We went to Pier39 after Alcatraz tour for lunch. Shops are placed very neatly, many restaurants and also interesting goods but I have a feeling most of the stuff is priced quite high and probably available for less elsewhere, but it is still worth walking through as it really is not just \"shop on shop\" architecture...Also most of the public transport halts here so it is nice \"midpoint\" between Golden Gate and Piers. A family friend recommended to visit Exploratorium, especially with the kids. And we did, with our children. I was expecting a usual science and technology museum or exhibition kind of experience. But I was totally wrong. This place is amazing and unique. It is a \"do it yourself, try it yourself\" kind of place, with hundreds of hands on experiments. From pendulum, to electric engines, animation techiniques, and many many more to list here.\\nChildren and adults can spend a full day, and may need more time. Apart from the obvious traffic, there are a lot of pedestrians and cyclists and you have to be very wary as there is a constant two way flow. The views back across to the city are not to be missed. Great seats, but the experience was poorer because of the unnecessary cost of the average fayre ? A dog and beer and a burger and coke, 40 bucks ?! And the Giants got beat ! It was my first trip to SFO.\\n\\nIts a great place to see SFO from the top. Nice place to hang around and spend time with family and friends. I am sure at night, the view would be as beautiful during the day This little aquarium had some hidden gems with bubble viewing within the display for children, touch pool, good educational displays. It&acute;s a nice respite within the chaos of Fisherman&acute;s Wharf. We thought this was a very nice mall and loved the escalators and Nordstrom&acute;s cologne department. We received excellent service their. However, our main appreciation was for their food court area where we had wonderful salmon and shrimp spring rolls at Bristol Farms Market. If you are downtown, this area in their Concourse will give you many more reasonable dining options. This company is near Fisherman&acute;s Wharf and they are the bright red double decker buses (except the one level bus that goes across the Golden Gate Bridge to Sausilito). They honored a previously posted price in the Guide book for us which was very kind of them. However, their buses run less frequently than the Maroon/Brown and gold Big Bus company buses or the Grayline red double decker buses. So buyer beware. We waited longer for this tour bus company than the others that we saw arrive multiple times while we waited. No trip to San Francisco is complete without a stroll down Pier 39. It&acute;s touristy, kitchy, lots of shops for souvenirs, food, candy and some decent restaurants. It&acute;s always packed during prime time; loud & crazy & the sea lions are most definitely the rock stars. Great views of the bay and Alcatraz. Highly recommend going early in the morning to avoid crowds and to just enjoy the stroll. As a native, I know this is hands down the best panoramic view of San Francisco, but also know its not the best place for dinner or service. My husband and I took advantage of the crystal clear weather during our recent stay in The City and just hit Top of The Mark around 2:30 in the afternoon for drinks. No lunch rush, no expectations other than a drink and time to soak in the stunning views. Worth every moment. We stayed within walking distance of the Ferry Building and it quickly became our first stop each morning. We grabbed breakfast at Market Bar, sitting out front under the bright yellow umbrellas; sampled different coffees, grabbed a bagel, so many fun new shops & restaurants. Then we&acute;d sat out back and relax watching the ferries come and go. And love the tower chime. Great place it start the morning. But beware, when it&acute;s lunchtime the financial crowd packs it full! We have previous Segway experience, but it really is intuitive and super-easy - that said, this was our first experience on public roads and first time up and down steep hills (SF has plenty of those). Melanie, our guide, was friendly, involving, knowledgeable - she paced the tour perfectly. Appropriate care and attention to the preliminaries and all safety aspects, then you&acute;re on your way for a 2 hour tour of the Streets of San Francisco. We did the (advanced) Lombard Street tour which gave us a good overview of the city, plus TWO runs down the famous Lombard Street. We felt safe and secure at all times, and the tour included some short breaks and photo opportunities. Perfect! Don&acute;t hesitate for a minute if the idea appeals to you - and remember to ask for Melanie!! We enjoyed our time at AT&T Park for a Giant game. The garlic fries were wonderful and something we hadn&acute;t had before. What we appreciated the most was the ease of using the MUNI metro to and front the park. The station was very close to the entrance and that was very nice. Beautiful architecture and a pre-movie organ with live organist! Unique movies as well including sing-alongs and classics. I think they updated the projector too. We come here regularly. It&acute;s a go-to place on a rainy day and outdoor options are rained out. We love the aquarium and the rainforest. Lots of active butterflies in the rainforest. There are 2 aquariums - a California Coast one and a Philippine Reef one. Next best thing to scuba diving!\\n\\nThe cafe is one of the best at a museum and better than cafes not in a museum! Be sure to book early because the boat ride is sold out days in advance most of the time. Alcatraz was the highlight of our visit to San Francisco. Shops, Eateries, and the smelly Seals...it is a Fun, full blown Tourist area or summer fun for locals. Along with Amusements and lots of History. Top of the Tourist areas in San Francisco... Recommend for a visit. Comfortable boat ride out. Make sure you take the audio tour. Very informative and keeps you on track. Be sure to wear comfortable shoes. A lot of walking and lots of hills This is a peaceful place to spend a warm afternoon and enjoy the lovely gardens. An unusual find close to the Science Museum and the Botanical Gardens which can be reached by the great bus services from the centre of SF. This is worth the visit as it shows you how the cable car is working today and you can look right down into the pit where the men are keeping this great attraction in San Fransisco running. It also has some great history to reveal about SF so do take a short time to visit. We took an open top city tour bus to see all the sights of San Francisco (very good cheap way to get around and see SF) and cross the Golden Gate Bridge. Fantastic sight and well worth the time. You can also walk or cycle the bridge but do be aware that SF is not only sunny, but windy also and the wind can be very cold. We were waring fleeces and coats at the end of June! But the trip was well worth the discomfort! This is always the hardest kind of review to write, because Smuggler&acute;s Cove is a very nice establishment with a cool tiki-bar vibe and an impressive collection of rum. It was a trend-setter in the national resurgence of tiki bars as a genre. But with that national resurgence of classic tiki bars going on, it&acute;s a shame that Smuggler&acute;s seems to be resting on its laurels after winning a bunch of awards from 2012-2014, instead of trying to be truly excellent... a bar caught up in its own image, instead of remembering what built it. Read on for more!\\n\\nLOCATION:\\nEasily accessible only two blocks west of Van Ness, Smuggler&acute;s Cove is easily accessible from nearly any part of the downtown area. Take an Uber, or else use one of the Van Ness bus lines (routes 47,49) to get off at McAllister, near City Hall, and walk the 2 blocks west.\\n\\nINSIDE:\\nThe bar is laid out on 3 floors with a small bar on the entry level, a larger bar and plenty of seating downstairs, and an upstairs \"balcony\" room. The vibe is fun and trendy, and the lanterns made from taxidemied puffer-fish let you know that, yes, you have arrived in the tropics. The small size means that there&acute;s generally a line outside, including at 4:45pm, 15 minutes before the joint opens. They control capacity pretty tightly, but even at that, the lines for some of the bars can get insanely long. (Note that this isn&acute;t necessarily a negative... good tiki drinks can take awhile to make!)\\n\\nDRINKS:\\nUnfortunately, while good tiki drinks take awhile to make, it seems that mediocre ones do too...\\n\\nThe bar offers an astounding collection of rums -- some rare and aged as well. They have a rum club, in fact, where frequent visitors can taste their way around the world. If you&acute;re coming to do a rum tasting, learn more about rum, or simply try different styles that you won&acute;t find elsewhere, then Smuggler&acute;s is your place. Rarely have I seen a more comprehensive collection anywhere on Earth.\\n\\nHowever, the mixed tiki drinks -- which should be the hallmark of a leading tiki bar -- were a disappointment, as was their service. The menu offers a wide selection of classic tiki staples, as well as some innovative new concoctions. Over the course of several drinks, they were a bitter disappointment.\\n\\nWell-known and loved classics came out with some of the worst, un-balanced flavors we&acute;ve encountered in the last 5 years. Most were so sour that the complexity of the herbal and spicy mixers included were utterly overpowered by the raw lime, and sweetness on several was nearly completely absent. One was notable enough that we actually sent it back to the bar to see if the downstairs bartender accidentally forgot a few of the ingredients... without even tasting it, we got a snapped-off \"that&acute;s how we make them here.\" Drinks from the upstairs bar were slightly more balanced, but unfortunately none of the cocktails were even top-10 quality in North American tiki lore.\\n\\nIt bears mentioning that, later, one of the bar assistants actually came out to apologize for the bartender, and offered us a replacement drink. We greatly appreciated the gesture and attempt at service recovery, and that kind of service bears applause, even if it should have been provided in the first place. Nontheless, the replacement drink was about the same disappointment as the first, so Smuggler&acute;s is clearly going for \"a taste\" in their drinks that fails to keep up with brilliant and evolving complexity and inventiveness of their peers nationwide.\\n\\nSUMMARY:\\nIf you&acute;re in SF and desperate for the tiki scene, Smugglers is a more laid-back and cozy venue than the touristy and garish Tonga Room across town. Unfortunately, the creative excellence that launched Smuggler&acute;s as a premiere bar in North America seems to have gone on hiatus, and those with a tiki establishment closer to home will likely be disappointed with what they&acute;re turning out these days. You just have to see it. And visit the Navy Memorial on the north side of the bridge. There&acute;s a couple of things you need to know - 1) SF has few clear days and of you&acute;re travelling only for a few days than you better time your visit up to the peak if you want views. 2) We went end of April late afternoon and it was freezing cold and windy even with two layers so we couldn&acute;t even hold the camera straight long enough to take some decent pics so carry a pair of gloves if you&acute;re not travelling in middle of summer. 3) Do this place first - there are so many other beatiful attractions in SF that it will pale out if you&acute;ve seen the others before.\\n\\nI wasn&acute;t particularly impressed with the views -its average and there are many other places in SF with better views There is no other place like Alcatraz anywhere else in the world - so yes go for it. We did the night tour and enjoyed everybit. The audio guide is free and a must - you cant just wander and not know anything about anything without the guide. The views of SF bay are spectacular. Much has much photographed, written and said about the GG but I can assure you that it&acute;s still underrated. This is one of America&acute;s top 10 attractions and a photographers wet dream. There is a mystique and feel about the GG that you cannot experience unless you see and photograph it from different angles, locations, lighting and weather conditions. It provides a different perspective everytime you see it.\\nGoogle the best locations to photograph the bridge, drive around and get lost scouting locations on both sides of the bridge - you wont be disappointed. The cable car ride is a must. Let the wind blow through your hair and hear the cable car drivers bark at you while clanging a bell. It&acute;s good stuff.',\n",
              " 'Had a lovely day trip on this ferry. There was loads of places to sit and as it was a beautiful day we sat on deck. Spent a couple of hours here enjoying the beautiful glass. A very calm and charming place. We visit early in the morning so it was quiet. The humor is not suitable for children under 17. Most of the comedy is based on homosexual and homophobic stereo types. ItвЂ™s like an adult inspired Muppet show - slapstick homo jokes.\\n\\nThere are some high points - the live band music is great, there are athleticism acts that are impressive, the juggling, the gymnastics and the intermission music is very entertaining. The singing is tired and all of the high points can be overshadowed by more and more references to gay dress and mannerisms.\\n\\nThe food is average and the pricing is expensive. If you can expense the cost of this event with your travel budget for work you&acute;ll probably have a better time that I did, but if youвЂ™re spending your personal money to buy tickets look for an alternative. Truly a visit to Seattle isn&acute;t complete without taking at least ONE ferry ride. We waited until after rush hour and just jumped on the Bremerton ferry; stayed on (well, you have to exit and come back on) and returned to the city. We were extremely fortunate to have beautiful weather and riding on such a big boat on the calm Puget Sound is amazing fun, not to mention a visual feast for the eyes. Highly recommend! As other reviewers have said, Pike Place Market is a MUST! Thankfully our hotel was a quick walk away since parking can be crazy. This place has shops, ceramic vendors, jewelry, food, artwork, and beautiful, gorgeous flowers everywhere. And what&acute;s not to love about the guys tossing fresh fish while an adoring crowd applauds?! If you can, go early when the vendors are setting up and you can still maneuver through the tourist crowds. Old fashioned, historic and most definitely a feast for all your senses. Great fun! While meandering through Post Alley we happened upon The Tasting Room around 2:30 in the afternoon, well after the lunch rush. What a wonderful wine shop and fabulous place to sit and enjoy some of the best local wines! We each selected a flight, then sat back and had amazing service. Thanks Tamera! Highly recommend! I take all of my out-of-town visitors here. Each one is disgusted at the very idea of The Gum Wall but upon seeing the Wall they all want to contribute. I&acute;ve never seen anything quite like The Gum Wall. For me it is one of the better attractions at Pike Place Market. Stop by, with a pack of gum, if you get the chance. We went on this tour due to a coupon from a website. You could get the same experience driving yourself around from Westlake Center to Belltown over to Pioneer Square and then back to Westlake Center whilst listening to terrible versions of holiday music (think: Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer) and telling corny jokes. There really aren&acute;t enough lights around downtown Seattle to really qualify it as a holiday lights tour. My suggestion for you (and me) next December: Visit the snow at Pacific Place, the tree at Westlake Center and walk down to the Waterfront Park @ Pier 58. Then buy a ticket for one of the tours that go on the water...I suspect that is more of what you&acute;re probably looking for. This is a must visit museum if you are in Seattle. From the Concorde (Alpha-Golf) which sits outside with the first Boeing 737-100, Air Force 1 Boeing 707 (VC-137), a Super Constellation, Boeing 727-100, and the very first Boeing 747-100 to the fantastic exhibits inside ranging from aircraft to space craft, through wall displays and the special tributes to the air men and women and aircraft of all the major wars I could easily have spent all day and more just browsing and soaking up information (unfortunately the family had other plans but I will return sometime to complete the job). Highlight of the visit for me was to listen to an air gunner on B-17&acute;s in World War Two tell a little bit about his experiences on missions deep into Germany. Well put together, we&acute;ll presented with friendly and informative staff this is the best aviation museum I have ever been to.\\n\\nExcellent and thoroughly recommended. Lovely old, Spanish colonial style cathedral. The choir sings at Sunday 10am Mass and was quite good.',\n",
              " 'We booked the trip with Reef Magic over the tour agent already, as it was cheaper than on their web page. It was also free for our 3 years old daughter.\\n\\nBus was promptly at the hotel and we went to the harbor. Everything was very quick and professional no long waiting. When boarding on the boat a photo is taken and you can buy it later on...(not really worth it, but if you buy many photos on USB stick it&acute;s OK).\\n\\nThere is free coffee and water on board and prices of other drinks are really reasonable. Yes you will be offered all possible additional things right after departure, but that is OK as they have to organize everything in advance before arrival to the platform so there is again no delays or whatsoever. Some people complain about that as \"they are after your money\", but that is not true. You are free to enjoy whatever you like. I was very happy to be able to do introductory scuba diving being without any experience as it was just AMAZING! It was so magical to be 5-10m under water surrounded by all those corals and marine life.\\n\\nMy only complain would be that underwater photos, which are very good by the way, are sold to expensive. Since I do not want a print, but the digital file itself I had to buy a USB stick with photos and that was something like $75. It&acute;s just too much, but how many photos of yourself with a very big fish (called Wally) in your hand do you have? Had a birthday dinner here. Nice with not too overly crowded setting ambience. $$$$ on the high side, but food was great. Had the tasting filet mignon selection on 3 types of AU, US and Wagyu beef. Nicely done with salad and french fries as a side and half lobster as add-on.\\n\\nOverall will recommend this as a choice restaurants to consider. Manage to finally step into Gardens by the Bay.\\n\\nRelatively big and nice area, however I notice that there isn&acute;t much green space at this point for picnicking. Most of the hype is around the skywalk, and the domes, so very much they are attractions geared towards tourists.\\n\\nAlso, there is no concession for local citizens and are charged the same price as tourists.\\n\\nNice part of it is that dogs are allowed as long as they are on leash and owners pick up after their poo poo.\\n\\nOverall, I should think that visiting the garden in the night would be a better choice as its lighted up and cooler I have been to Singapore several times, but had not yet made it here until my most recent visit. I visited on a cloudy Sunday morning, hoping the rain would hold off, and was very happy that it did! The botanic gardens themselves are much bigger than I expected - you can easily spend 2 -3 hours looking around.\\n\\nAlthough I am no botanist, the plants are interspersed with a variety of sculpture and other interesting things along the way - you find something new around every corner!\\n\\nThe highlight was definitely the orchid garden - so many beautiful flowers, and the peace and tranquility of the place really was special. It really is worth the $5 fee to get in. Botanic gardens have a full UNESCO Orchid collection. Ensure plenty of time to visit there during daylight then head to the Orchid collection. This is something beyond word description. All types, colors, lush greenery and all the petal textures beautifully organized. I think this was the most impressive botanic garden ever visited. Refresh yourself with apple and aloe vera juice. Dress lightly and carry an extra battery to take photos If you are not a hotel guest, you get limited access to the skypark. For $20, it provided very little value. They even tried to charge $14 for 2 years olds when almost every other attraction in Singapore is free for toddlers. The pools and views were nice.\\n\\nYou will not be able to take any amazing photographs of yourself and the cityscape. A souvenir shop is however nearby who will willingly photoshop your picture on some nice backdrop. Artificial and expensive. Tony is the real deal if you are seeking local insights from a learned and passionate gentleman. An easy entry for any tourist or even local seeking to learn a bit more about Singapore food culture and its origins. With an international mindset and overseas experiences in UK and Australia, Tony connects brilliantly with Westerners whether over fried Hokkien noodles or a cold pint of ale...if there is time, history buffs can get more insights from Tony. For foodies, just enjoy the tours and bring your appetite. Marina Bay Sands Skypark dominates the skyline across the bay. The viewing platform at the top is a very big wooden deck / style platform with wide views across the city of Singapore. We visited this during the middle of the day, (very bright and the glare was quite strong, so be sure to take sunglasses), which was fabulous to see as the day was reasonably clear, however I can imagine the view would also be good to see early morning or night time. This platform is much higher than the Singapore Flyer (giant ferris wheel which you can look down on from the platform) so views much vaster from Skypark. what a spectacular waste of money to build this. Why would anyone pay good money and spend their time visiting man-made concrete buildings covered with plants with little or poorly written educational information? what is the point of this whole construction? or the dome next door of potted plants with no signs? avoid this place. you will be better off at the free Botanic gardens or just visiting your local nursery where at least you will know what plants you are looking at. Had a few beers here on Saturday night - $20 plus tax for a pint of Stella, $25 plus tax for a Long Island - it&acute;s not badly priced but 6.00pm - 8.30pm is rammed as this place is perfect for a pre-dinner sundowner and everyone around me were there for a drink and eating elsewhere. Apparently it is never quiet but it calms down after the laser light show (8pm)\\n\\nGo to tower 3 of The Marina Bay Sands and get a restaurant pass from the Ku De Ta concierge on the ground floor before taking the lift to the 57th floor.\\n\\nWell worth it, and better for me than spending the price of a drink on access to the Skypark which this bar overlooks! After a couple of beers on Saturday night in Ku De Ta (Marina Bay Sands 57th Floor Bar is a must for the view which is free at $20 per pint!) I started chatting to the Ultimate Drive staff on the ground floor, and just thought &acute;what the heck, life is too short not to do this&acute;.\\n\\nAfter &acute;negotiating&acute; a 10% discount (show your Singapore Airlines boarding pass or booking, also discounted for hotel guests) I turned up just before 1pm on Sunday for my 15 minute, $286.97 (after discount and GST) drive in a Lamborghini Gallardo Spyder (0-100kmph in 3.7 seconds!)\\n\\nA lots of signatures, disclaimers, and iPhone photos later I was sat in the Lambo, engine running, adrenalin flowing.........waiting.........\\n\\n\"manual or automatic sir?\"............oh God, a decision.......\"manual please!\"\\n\\nAfter some very quick instructions on the gear changes and the automatic change down (which is brilliant) and off we go, roof down, sun blazing, and roads quiet. \"you are clear sir..........\"\\n\\nJEEEZZZZZ! the sound of it as I plant my right foot, remember to change to 2nd gear and plant again......\"we are doing a U-turn here sir!\"...........ok, calm down, take control of this raging bull and soak it up.\\n\\nClear road.....GO!......2nd gear, 3rd, 4th 132KMPH accross the bridge and stop at the traffic lights......breath again.....\\n\\n\"turn right here sir\"........we enter the road that are being set up for the F1 GP in 2 weeks time, crash barriers, spectator stands, lighting ....GO again!...............\\n\\n15 minutes later, the smile on my face cannot be removed, the brakes are squealing from hard braking, the engine is fluttering and I park the bull back at Marina Bay Sands.\\n\\n\"congratulations - the best drive I have ever seen sir!\".............................ok made that bit up.\\n\\n\"would you like to see the video sir?\" - video? you filmed that????\\n\\nA small dash camera recorded me, the windscreen view, GPS speed and location. After seeing it back and shown how to transfer the files between windows and Mac I was relieved of another $62.06 (inclusive of GST) for the video on USB but was very happy to pay this.\\n\\nI always say that value is a relative thing. I would not have had as much fun if it was raining (roof on) or if I had driven on a week day (heavier traffic) or even if it had not been so close to the Grand Prix as the roads were already ready for it with crash barriers etc, it really did feel like driving on a F1 circuit.\\n\\nSo, for me, a perfect experience on a perfect day, and 15 minutes was just enough to take on the whole experience.\\n\\nPlan in advance, pick a weekend, and enjoy. Life is too short not to. Gorgeous, gorgeous gorgeous. A must for anyone who visits singapore. however, bear in mind that singapore is a humid place so when u visit this garden, please bring sunscreen, hat and sunglasses. Otherwise, its a paradise! I have not been to the zoo for ages so my thought of it was caged animals being depressed. This is far from it. The general feel is that the animals are in their own natural habitat. Really well done SIngapore Zoo. The shows are also entertaining too! I am an avid spa fan and must say that this is probably the best spa experience bar none!\\n\\nThe atmosphere and setting is flawless. You are surrounded by the ultimate luxury from the peacocks.. to the orchid fountains.. to the sexy mud baths, jacuzzis and the many waterfalls.. This is luxury at its finest.\\n\\nThe service is also impeccable. The staff has been trained so well, i simply cannot fault the service. 5 stars on service alone!\\n\\nIn regards to the actual products.. I had an hour scrub and another hour of massage. It was nothing short of divine. I cannot gush enough.\\n\\nSpa Botanica is absolutely flawless and worth all the accolades and achievements it has garnered. It is simply the best.',\n",
              " 'Year after year, when we return to the St Pete area, one of our stops is Florida Orange Groves and Winery. The friendly staff is ever happy to share a tasting with my wife, and she always finds a new flavor to bring home. Her favorite is Blueberry Blue, ever since we shared a bottle watching the sunset at St Pete Beach . . . A world class institution that blends the Louvre, Versailles and the V&A. Of course if your time is short a guided tours will have its benefits, but we saw dozens of groups seemly fly by, it was hard to understand how their appreciation could be anything other than cursory. From the art of the 13th cent. European \"dark ages,\" to prehistoric Siberia, we were there when it opened (1030) and left when it closed(1800) and felt we missed a lot. And the Greater Throne was ethereal. I decided to go to this museum because 6 years ago or so we had gone to the Miro museum in Barcelona. I am familiar with Miro, but not Dali or his works so I was intrigued. The museum and the surrounding area with the view of the water and theater from the museum is spectacular. The $21 admission price for 1 floor of the unique artwork, not so hot. I thought that there would be a lot of art to peruse throughout the 3 floors, but it&acute;s only the top floor you get. I wish I had known about the Thursdays after 5 pm $10 deal, but I didn&acute;t. I listened to the audio tour and looked at the main exhibit for about an hour, so the $21 admission price really was not worth it. The Miro museum in Barcelona was dirt cheap because we had a Barcelona card, but even without it I googled the entrance price and it is now about $12, but the place is huge, inside and outside to see the sculptures, paintings, cloth/canvas creations, and we had spent a good 3 hours walking around unlike this Dali museum.\\n\\n$10 is an ok deal just to see this place once in your life to see one of the greatest artists of time, but do it on Thursdays after 5 pm and then it will be a 4 or 5. I live in D.C. where the art museums are free, so paying $42 for 2 adults for only one measly floor you can see in 45 minutes to an hour was definitely not worth it. Yes is big and beautiful, but in Saint Petersburg there are other churches which are much more remarkable. There&acute;s no information on the displays (you must rent an audio guide), but the exhibition is really fantastic, as well the restored building. I&acute;m very travelled and visited many museums around the world, but the Hermitage is awesome for anyone. You can&acute;t really visit it in a single day and probably the only one where the beauty of the building is comparable to the masterpieces in its rooms. Outside you can&acute;t guess how beautiful it is. Inside is really huge and impressive. The decoration is stunning. Probably the most stunning church in Russia. Not so famous as St. Basil&acute;s Cathedral (in Moscow), but much bigger and by all means, much more beautiful. If you have time, it deserves a visit, because the czars are buried in the cathedral inside the fortress. The church itself is also beautiful and its golden needle catches your eyes when you are at the other side of Neva River. It&acute;s a little far from the main touristic circuit and there&acute;s nothing special to see inside. Only for those with a deep interest in Russian history. It seems more a political building (like the Capitol) than a cathedral. Inside is beautiful, but after you see other churches in St. Petersburg, this one is not so impressive. No pictures allowed and you will see at the entrance an advise: \"Please, be careful, or become a victim of theft\". Today is basicaly a museum and outside seem s more a Roman temple than a cathedral. Inside is very beautiful and huge. For sure, deserves the visit. I didn&acute;t go to the colonade (outside the dome) where there&acute;s a view from St. Petersburg. At least during the summer, is open until 10 pm. This is the only museum I visited which the museum itself competes in beauty with the masterpieces which are inside. Even if the museum was empty, it would be wonderful. To give an ideia, Hermitage seems to be like Versailles having inside the masterpieces of Louvre. One day is absolutely not enough, even if you skip some sections that you have seen similar elsewhere (like mummies). Try to visit on Wednesday because it&acute;s open until 9 pm and avoid the first Thursday of the month (because entrance is free and the lines are enormous). Probably is the most beautiful church in Russian style in all country. Those impressed with St. Basil&acute;s (Moscow) will not be disappointed, I&acute;m sure. You can&acute;t miss it. We booked the two day tour and the fun vodka cruiser for the evening for our stay in St. Petersburg while on a cruise. Both day tours and teh cruise were fantastic. We had great guides who spoke excellent English and our driver (Sergi) was amazing.\\nThe organisation was first class and the guides knowledge was unbelievable. I would recoment this tour company, and this tour while you are in St. Petersburg We had a spare couple of hours before our flight home and really felt we had seen enough churches and magnificent buildings in our 6 days in Russia so decided to visit the museum (primarily to see the baby mammoth).\\nOn attempting to pay we were told it was free because it was the last Thursday of the month. It was busy with well behaved school children being given guided tours but the room (and it was just one large room) was very spacious so this was not a problem.\\nWe found it very different from other &acute;natural history&acute; museums - cases and cases of birds, animals and insects and larger displays in the centre - ranging from what appeared to be the content of a cats and dogs home to mammoths and blue whale skeletons.\\nWe all really enjoyed our visit here - very different! We were told about having to queue for hours to get in here and so were pleasantly surprised by the fact we walked straight up to the ticket desk and were the only people in the ticket hall at 11am! No charge for children under 18 which was another surprise.\\nBrilliantly laid out and organised - an amazing spectacle.',\n",
              " 'Just walking in Gamla Stan streets is worthy walk. It was great to see all of the old beautiful buildings & the canals surrounding. It was beautiful that historical part of Stockholm. The tagging should be removed, but otherwise it is a very Nice and safe place to visit. Loved the atmosfere As we have been here before, we didn&acute;t spend too much time this time: just small walk and a coffee. Overall old town was as those usually are: crowded and full of shops that offer mostly souvenirs. We enjoyed other areas off Stockholm much more, although buildings in old town are of course beautiful! The Christmas market in the middle was excellent and our 11 month old daughter really enjoyed the music and the dancing around the Christmas tree!\\nThe stalls in the market were very varied and there was lots of treats to buy. We visited in December and there was snow on the ground. It was beautiful, the Christmas market small but very festive and fun.\\nLots of lovely shops and restaurants to browse and enjoy. What can I say about a visit to the Vasa Museum that has not been said before? It is one of the best attractions in Europe if not the world. It is located within 15 minute walk from the center of Stockholm and the Grand Hotel. The story of the ship&acute;s creation, sinking and remarkable salvaging and restoration is unique in the world. I advise watching the 15-20 minute introductory film then taking one&acute;s time exploring the ship from different vantage points from all floors of the museum. There so much to see here that I would recommend at least 2-3 hours. We were on a tour from our cruise ship and only had one hour, which was insufficient, but we saw and absorbed a lot. We will return here when we next visit Stockholm as the restoration is a work in progress. I can&acute;t rate this as a local but my husband and I stumbled across this place and we were plainly the only tourists in there - the rest of the crowd assembled on the pretty roof terrace was a smart Friday-night young local crowd and we loved it for that. Our drinks took ages at the bar where the mixologists were whipping up a storm to a biggish queue but my Cape Town cocktail was amazingly good and one I shall be looking to replicate at home. If you are a visitor to Stockholm and looking for something expensive but a vibey local scene, this is it. Had we been there for longer we would have returned another night. (With apologies to Stockholmers who are going to think I am talking complete rubbish!). If you only do one cultural thing in Stockholm, do this. From the moment you walk into the museum&acute;s hall and see the VAST ship you will be totally spellbound. It has a real presence and the whole visit was absolutely fascinating. We were in there for nearly 2 hours as the exhibitions, over 3 floors, are incredibly informative. In particular we spent a lot of time at the skeletons and facial reconstructions of the crew. A Must See.',\n",
              " 'I&acute;ve visited Stratford a number of times since the Tower has been built but only went up on my visit this week. As the other TA reviewers have said, the views from the top are fantastic. It&acute;s nice to be able to walk all the way round to see down the river and past Trinity Church as well as across the expanse of the town. All the rootfops reminded me a bit of being at the top of a campanile in Italy!\\n\\nFor ВЈ2.50, it&acute;s great value. The staff at the RSC are always very helpful and interesting. The lady I spoke to said how lovely the views are in winter, which really made me want to go back in another season to see how it looks then. The Stratford Town walk is a 2 hour plus walking tour of the main attractions in the town. I learnt a lot while on the tour last week and Helen, our guide, was knowledgeable and fun. It&acute;s a nice mixture of historical detail, Shakespearean quotes and fun facts and I would highly recommend it. Lots of little details you would otherwise miss and bits of information about the town that are fascinating. Would highly recommend and thanks to Helen for two and a half great hours! This is where Shakespeare&acute;s grave is, and a few members of his family, which is quite interesting if you&acute;re in Stratford to see the Shakespeare sights. I suppose you can understand that it&acute;s become a tourist trap, and I didn&acute;t begrudge paying the ВЈ2 pp entry, but somehow it felt like I was paying to see a circus attraction. This is a fairly interesting place, where the guides will tell you bits and pieces of info about it, but it&acute;s not the most interesting of the shakespeare houses. They&acute;ve done the best I think you can with it though, so worth a look if you&acute;re in stratford for the shakespeare experiences. And you may as well go if you&acute;ve bought the 5 house ticket! The production of Julius Caesar was excellent, although as the setting had been superimposed to modern day africa (which worked fine), it meant some of the accents were difficult to follow all the time - and sometimes Shakespear can tough enough as it is!\\nI found the seating a little uncomfortable though, as you had to lean forward to be able see the whole stage. Got quite warm in the theatre as well. I visit here often, and I love it a bit more every time. Easily reached from the M40 motorway, yet surrounded by bucolic countryside, this little stately home houses an amazing art collection. The grounds are magnificent (and currently host to a wonderful collection of Moore and Rodin Sculptures. There is plenty to keep children occupied, indoors and out!\\n\\nChoice of a cafeteria or the restaurant. We opted for afternoon tea - what a bargain! Sandwiches, home made cakes, scones with jam and clotted cream. Add a glass of Prosecco each - and it was less than ВЈ30 for the two.\\n\\nDelightful staff, for whom nothing is too much trouble.\\n\\nOne of my favourite places in Warwickshire. Don&acute;t get a day ticket - it is much better value to buy the annual pass and come back - again and again! It has been more than thirty years since I was last here and some things of course have changed and some things I have forgotten. The staff are very knowledgeable and tell some good yarns about the house so take the trouble to hear what they have to say you will learn some great little pieces of information about the history of the English language and of course learn all about Anne Hathaway, her family and Mr Shakespeare&acute;s courting of her. The gardens are lovely and you may even get to met a friendly tortoiseshell coloured cat! It is easy to write off the Shakespeare Centre as nothing more than a money making venture trading off the reputation of the bard but this is a great place to pay a visit. Apart from the importance in history and in the reputation of Stratford-upon-Avon altogether, the house is a great place to visit packed full of great little gems of history about Shakespeare&acute;s life and times. Additionally the gardens are lovely and with this year being a significant anniversary there are some additions like the literature wall. In the garden on a nice day they have enthusiasts playing out pieces from his plays on demand. Great Fun! Buy a ticket to all the different historical places in the area and save! If you visit the house and assume your visit is done you&acute;ve missed the most important bits! The garden is a great little secret filled with ancient mulberry trees, sculptures and plants. Encounter the stuff in the house - there are some great pieces and experiential exhibits but don&acute;t forget the garden!',\n",
              " 'We love Watson&acute;s bay. You can get there easily by bus of ferry. The eating there is somewhat touristy and I don&acute;t recommend it, but this is a great place to start a walk, whether a short one up to the lighthouse at the Gap or a long one all the way to Bondi. We never tire of the cliffs, the view and the ocean. We booked the tour to Blue Mountains with Activity Tours based on the reviews. Steve was our guide for the day. Bus arrived promptly and we headed off to the Featherdale Wildlife Park first, then waterfalls, then lunch, then three sisters etc etc etc...\\n\\nWe saw A LOT of things and this is what 1 day tours are all about! Yes it is rushed, yes you have to hurry sometimes, but this is the ONLY way you can see as much in one day. Since we liked the Featherdale Wildlife Park so much (you can pet koalas&kangaroos as much as you like for no additional cost) , we went there again on our own.\\n\\nAnother reason for being strict on time limits is that this operator really does a great job at being first at the locations which are shared by huge number of tours!\\n\\nLunch time is quite limited (50min) and I do not suggest you to go for \"restaurants\", but rather something instantly made - fast food. Went the first Saturday night of this year&acute;s festival. So did many many others. We had a beautiful night and the festival is engaging across a really wide universe of participants. It tend to go for grandiose rather than subtle but despite the crowds is a terrific night out for families, couples or roughly anyone. The Sydney Harbour Bridge is spectacular. And you can walk across for free. You can take a train across. You can drive across. You can do the Sydney Bridgeclimb.\\n\\nNot to be missed no matter which way you do it. It just makes Sydney unique! The centre of Sydney revolves around the harbour, but the outlying parts are well worth a visit, especially those not served by Ferry, although you need some local advice about those! Lots of things to do over there for everyone. There is the Aquarium that my husband & I enjoyed very much. The shopping center looked good but we weren&acute;t in the mood. The view of the sea with the boats was relaxing & I enjoyed really. It&acute;s a good place to hang out for everyone; singles, couples & families. It is beautiful to walk there & grab some ice cream or smoothie and enjoy the view of the Bridge Harbour & the Opera House. There are restaurants and cafe`s. I enjoyed the music played by some artists. Some physical performances are there too, especially in the weekend. It is a beautiful place to relax and just enjoy your time. Also, one can take a ferry or a cruise from the decks over there. We went on the Craft Beer Walking Tour yesterday (8/11/2014) and what a fantastic afternoon. Tour takes in the historic \"Rocks\" area of Sydney and included visiting six pubs.\\nYou buy your own beers so you can have as much or as little as you like.\\nWe also had a Coat of Arms pizza, kangaroo on one side and emu on the other.\\nWell worth going and we learnt a lot of Australian history, David was a fantastic guide and knew so much about the beer, pubs and surrounds. Fantastic show, great food and a good choice of drinks. Just a very good night out.\\nWell done. The value for money was exceptional. We booked a family trip to celebrate a son&acute;s 21st birthday, and as an excuse for the family and partners to get together doing something fun, in the fresh air. The adult tickets cost $150 each, and the students (even though adult-age students) were $135 - seemed a little steep but they were well worth it. Even though we live in Sydney and frequently use ferries it was an absolute pleasure to sail the length of the harbour (and seem to just &acute;scrape&acute; under the harbour bridge) on this beautiful ship, before getting under sail and going out into the ocean through Sydney Heads. The volunteer crew on board were very knowledgable and entertaining, including the banjo player/singer who kept us entertained with sea shanties and little singalongs through the day. All the passengers took part in various activities including heaving on ropes to get sails up and down, pounding ships biscuit to make a variation of biscuit, ringing the ships bell to mark the changing hours etc. It was possible to climb up the rigging to a crows nest for a birds eye view, for a fee of $75. All very safe as you are attached to a 2-point harness and a crewmember climbs alongside you. The birthday boy did the climb and stayed up there for quite a while enjoying the view. We were looking for whales out in the ocean but didn&acute;t see any. See the ship under sail is magnificent and our voyage was not too rough. We had taken Kwells beforehand and no-one was sick in our group. We were on board from 9.15am until we berthed at 4pm and disembarked and it was really a fun day. Very relaxing and enjoyable. Of course there was also the excitement of sailing through lots of smaller yachts taking part in races near Sydney Heads, and some near misses. I had a gluten free meal, and everyone in our group thought the snacks and lunch was fine. Plenty of tea and coffee included, plus you could buy soft drinks and alcohol if you wished. It is interesting below decks seeing the little cabins and captain&acute;s area. Thanks again to the crew who did the bulk of the hard work in getting sails up and down. We would highly recommend this day trip. I think its often booked out weeks in advance so try and get in as far ahead as you can. A memorable day trip on a bit of history. I probably would not recommend children younger than 10 or so go on this day trip. The ship rolls around a bit and they might get bored, plus you do need to take care amongst all the activity going on that you aren&acute;t in the way or in danger. Take a hat (which will stay on), wind/rainjacket, and sensible shoes. They provide sunscreen. Whilst a timeless icon they do not miss you on the price. Certainly no Hong Kong. A must do in Sydney and enjoyable nonetheless. So much to see and do!! Loved being down on the water at The Rocks and The Opera House... So much activity and atmosphere Where else in the world can you climb a public bridge legally!\\n\\nDid the express climb which was perfect = check sunset times to plan your climb perfectly. Took that fast ferry from Pier 6 ($18 Return, 18 minutes each way) which is a great sightseeing trip. Arrived at the pier and there are bars there (ate at The Bavarian Bar) with a beach either side which were ok but not &acute;wow&acute;. It was only when I met a mate that he told me that the proper beach was the other side of the bay, a short walk through the town!\\n\\nWhen I got to the real beach it was excellent, great surf, clearly marked swimming areas and facilities, not the best beach in the world (Barbados?) but very good and well worth spending the day there.\\n\\nFirst &acute;official&acute; day of summer so 28 degrees and burnt nose! This is a great walk with stunning views. The path is easy to follow and has several stop/ picnic points along the way. There are a number of steps involved but being a coastal walk this is to be expected. Allow 3 hours to complete including a break. Well worth making the effort. Catch a bus from across the Spit bridge back into Sydney Decided to visit Powerhouse purely by chance and ended up spending 6 hours there. It is a fabulous museum with so many interesting things to see and do. Exhibits all laid out extremely well and there are a lot of interactive exhibits to explore. A huge variety of different things to see and do and great value for money. If you have time, a great place to visit We returned to Watsons Bay several times as we were so impressed with it. There is a lovely beach and great walk round the headland and up to the lighthouse. The only disappointment was Doyles take away closing early in the afternoon We used the ferries extensively on our recent trip and found them to be punctual and good value for money. All the staff were very helpful and courteous We took a tour on the small \"train\" around the gardens which are beautiful in themselves. The tour is great value and very interesting. Lots to see and the pathway is excellent. Not too energetic with some lovely views over the coastline.',\n",
              " 'This is a safe, well run tour and a decent value for the price.\\n\\nPick up was extremely punctual.\\n\\nDriver ( Duncan) was very pleasant and low key. I actually felt at times he was too quiet but that&acute;s not really a criticism.\\n\\nThe van was clean and well maintained. Duncan was very good about making sure we weren&acute;t too hot or too cold by asking us if we needed AC adjusted.\\n\\nTour stops were pleasant and well timed. The mini church was kind of silly but the fruit market ( the real attraction at this brief stop) is terrific. We bought a small bag of cherries to snack on.\\n\\nTown of Niagara on the Lake is beautifully scenic. Take a brief walk down to the lake shore ( driver will point you in that direction). If it&acute;s clear you can see Toronto across the lake. Grab a sandwich on the Main Street and bring it with you. We ate ours at the next stop, the winery. The winery was pleasant and interesting. A brief stop with free wine tasting and zero pressure to buy.\\n\\nThe stop at Niagara Falls was great and gave us plenty of time. We took the boat ride option and its memorable and not too long. They get you escorted to the boat line and we got on within a few minutes.\\n\\nRide back is more on the quiet side. Time to rest and think about your experience at the falls.\\n\\nI&acute;m glad I booked our tour with this company and thank other TA reviewers for pointing us in the right direction.\\n\\nBTW: I found out they have smaller, private tours if you want to book just for your own group. Loved it ! What more can I say ! Great views frm the top, the glass floor aint for the faint hearted ! Its hady to get to on the tube. Good shops, alot still expensive but some like Tommy good value, friendly staff and hot lol Its a must do in Toronto ! Great exibits, friendly staff, good size, not as big as New York but decent This was our daughter&acute;s choice as she particularly wanted to visit the Living in Space exhibition but we all thoroughly enjoyed the museum - it really brings home to you how much transport has evolved in only 100 years. Comfortable and roomy seats with plenty of leg room and unobstructed views - what more do you want from a theatre? An enjoyable art gallery to visit. A very Canadian collection, a bit weak on European but some good temporary exhibitions when we visited. I went up there both during the day and evening and was well worth seeing both aspects. Standing on the glass floor with the tremendous drop below was a bit scary but safe. It&acute;s just a shame it is difficult to take good photographs through the outside mesh. Well not much to say other than if you are a hockey fan, you need to come visit...If you are from out of town, make sure you put aside some as this is a can&acute;t miss place to come to if you like the game of ice. Old Distillery brought back to life with restored Victorian Industrial buildings. You can find some good food, drinks and shops, but think of this as a 90 stop if your not sitting down to eat. I found the shops a little expensive and lacking in variety, but it is a charming place. if your looking for a quick bite, try the fish and chips at the back of the market, but great selection of cheese, meats etc in a nice clean environment about a 10 minute walk east of union station on Front Street',\n",
              " 'Even if you dont like flowers and pot plants, you need to see how this former Granite Qurary has been transformed into a paradise. The landscape engineering is impressive, and then you should visit the marina in Victoria.\\n\\nOur bus driver and guide was Wayne. He was easily confused when taking repeated headcounts on the bus. He was a very good driver, but less than impressive as a knowledgeable and dynamic guide. No tip.\\n\\nThe ferry ride too and from Vancouver takes 90 minutes eachway and was very well organized. I really like being on the Pacific waters. Take in the beautful views of islands, sail boats and the sun setting. You&acute;l need your camera. What a great way to spend the day! My partner and I didn&acute;t actually intend on going here but sort of just ended up there as we wandered through Stanley Park with no particular destination in mind. Well, I can honestly say I am very glad we went.\\nUnlike so many other places like this, it doesn&acute;t seem to have one big signature attraction (think Shamu) but instead had loads of diverting displays and critters which it manages to organise beautifully.\\n\\nI didn&acute;t expect there to be so much to see and we managed to spend several hours here without boredom or tedium settling in. Penguins, snakes, caiman, rainforests, frogs, bats, insects...you name it. I have been to places like this before but I am struggling to think of one that I enjoyed more.\\n\\nDo yourselves a favour-spend a day here. We were 2 adults with no kids so I can only guess how much fun kids would have here, but my guess is that it would be a lot!! The skytrain which has three lines including the Canada Line to the airport is part of an efficient, integrated and cheap public transport system. The day passes are particularly good value. We visited the Vancouver Aquarium for the first time since they did a ton of upgrades and we were very impressed with the changes they made! The building and entrance looks far more grand and more what you&acute;d expect to see at a top tourist destination, and it flows much better than it use to.\\n\\nThere was a lot of staff on hand to answer questions and we loved the Clownfish Cove play area for kids (including bathrooms for pint sized visitors!) We noticed the Dolphin show is not as showy as it use to be, and I&acute;m assuming that&acute;s due to so many complains about the treatment of the animals. Everything they did during the Dolphin show were things Dolphins do normally and it was very educational.\\n\\nWe had a great time and my boys loved it. They learned a lot and I&acute;m sure we&acute;ll be back! We&acute;ve made it a recent tradition to take our son to Bright Nights at Stanley Park each December\\nWe always buy our train tickets online a few weeks previous to the event through ticket master (they do sell out!) and try to attend early in the season. *Note* only the train costs money - you can see the other lights for free. event parking is also free.\\n\\nWe enjoy walking the paths looking at the many scenes and set ups while holiday music plays in sync with the lights. We find it takes about half an hour to see it all (not including the train.) there are other activities offered such as a meeting with Santa, face painting and live music, food is available for purchase too\\n\\nThe Christmas train is themed every year to something different. Last year it was the Polar Express and this year was a fun disco theme that included music from the Jackson 5 and Boney M. The train ride lasts about 10 minutes and children 2 and under are free, so we feel like we&acute;re getting our money&acute;s worth. The train sits two adults comfortably.\\n\\nThis is a great family activity to get you in the Christmas spirit! We are local Vancouverites and love doing a yearly trip to the Aquarium! The price for all day admission is $21 per adult and $13 for a child (3 and under are free.)\\n\\nThere is so much to see that you at least need half a day to see everything. The outside tanks hold Beluga Whales (there is a show), Dolphins (also has a show) Ottors and Sea Lions.\\n\\nInside their are numerous tanks that hold tropical fishes, octopuses, sea horses, sharks, etc. You can also see bats, bugs, frogs and sloths!\\n\\nOne of the highlights for us is visiting the 4-D show which is much like something youd see in Disneyland. Inside the movie theatre you watch a movie and literally experience the sights, sounds, smells and feel of whatever you are watching. Very enjoyable!\\n\\nThere is a restaurant on site that serves hamburgers, hotdogs, sandwhiches etc, but it is on the pricey side. We usually will bring our own packed lunch. There is also a large gift shop with every kind of souvanier you can imagine.\\n\\nIf you are visiting Vancouver as a tourist I highly suggest you plan to attend the Aquarium. We love it! My wife, adult daughter, and I had a simply terrific Chinatown tour with Leni. We&acute;re walking tour groupies, but we&acute;ve never had such an fun and fascinating tour. There was no sugar-coating of the history of discrimination toward the Chinese, and Leni provided great and clear historical context. But Leni was clearly a fan and advocate of Vancouver, for all its historical warts, so she was very upbeat. She also gave us some great leads on restaurants in Chinatown and throughout the city. She was simply terrific, and we have a great opinion of Tour Guys as a result. Trip of a lifetime on the two days from Calgary to Vancouver (via Kamloops)\\n\\nAs others have said, if you can manage Goldleaf then it is so worth it...The service we received from the moment we left the Fairmont Palliser and walked next door to the rail terminal was utterly faultless.\\nSo what are the main positives:\\n* You never have to lift or carry your luggage (even at the final station, it is put on a trolley for you)\\n* The upper tier view from the dome carriage is terrific\\n* There is masses of legroom even with your hand luggage under the seat in front,\\n* Nobody will fade away from hunger as outside of main meals, snacks are bought round at various intervals...scones & jam / cheese & crackers.\\n* Once the free bar opened mid morning - it didnt close, with all manner of wines, beers & spirits\\n* The food and menu choices were excellent and the service was outstanding\\n* The cabin staff were great fun and really knowledgeable.\\n* As you are sharing tables of 4 during Breakfast & Lunch - a great opportunity to meet like minded travellers from around the world!\\n\\n...And the negatives - difficult to find any.\\nAll i would comment on is something that many other Trip Advisors have previously mentioned and that is the frequent stops.\\nYou are sharing a railroad track and goods trains take priority, therefore the stops can be for 15 - 30 minutes (our longest was for an hour - but we were eating lunch so who cares) This seriously delayed our first night into Kamloops (arrived well after 11pm), but they served us a very tasty light Roast chicken dinner in our main seats and the wine carried on flowing.\\nSome have commented on the quality of the hotels in Kamloops, but our room was far from basic and quite spacious and the staff were terrific - with all due respect to Kamloops, I kind of wasn&acute;t expecting a Ritz Carlton!\\n\\nOn this particular two day trip the scenery isnt quite so breathtaking on day two but it is no less fantastic.\\nFor us, it really was the journey of a lifetime and far exceeded our expectations....and truly 5 star all the way\\nBook Goldleaf and you wont be dissapointed',\n",
              " 'This grand structure is stunning as it dominates the end of the piazza but for all it&acute;s pomp, the interior is a bit lack-lutster. Fortunately, it&acute;s one of the few things one can do in Venice that doesn&acute;t have an entrance fee, so really, there is no reason not tour it but it&acute;s kind of like the many mask stores and pizza joints one passes in Venice... glitzy and huge with the tourists but lacking real flavor.\\n\\nHaving visiting a number of churches in Venice. There are others that are less known, less visited and much grander in my opinion. Just like the good pizza places and the good mask shops, one has to seek them out but the reward is worth it. Spent time here in the mornings for coffee and afternoons for drinks - great people watching, variety of restaurants & cafes, and a gelato shop where you can get a cone for 1 euro! Highly recommended. Particularly enjoyed cafe rosso and Orange for afternoon drinks. An art collection that won&acute;t appeal to all but go with an open mind, you&acute;ll find osmething to reflect on! The gardens are so peaceful and quaint and I love the wishing tree. Great views of the canal as well and a small intimate collection. This place is really nice on postcards and a place where you stand for ten minutes, take some photos then leave! I would stay in this part of Venice if I stayed again as it is a bit uieter but also more authentic. Great small bars and restuarants to be found here! Good permanent collection, also good temporary exhibition on Pollock brothers, The house and grounds are spectacular. Our guide Elinor was very good. We learnt some very interesting things and then could wander through the public places and the Bridge of Sighs by ourselves I almost didn&acute;t go to Venice because I had heard from several people how crowded it was. I am so glad that I found Nadia and decided to visit Venice because it turned out to be one of my favorite cities. Nadia has a big heart and a big personality. Our family of six, including two teenagers and elderly parents really enjoyed our tour. She took us through all the back streets to avoid the crowds but also to see the real Venice. She works with one water taxi company, and out taxi driver was really good. Once we got to San Marco square (at the end of the tour after a nice cappuccino and cookies at the library for a break) I could understand why people wouldn&acute;t like Venice. San Marco square was amazing but the crowd - forget it! Stay there 5 minutes and move on. We took the train there and back from Florence in one day. Make sure you get clear directions on how to get back to the train station. Venice is built like a maze so we got lost getting back to the station. The Grand Canal IS Venice. You can see the Grand Canal on foot, on Gondola, or on Vaporetto and I would recommend all of the above. Venice is an amzing city and the buildings along the Grand Canal are breathtaking. (The Grand Canal is also essential for finding your way around the sometimes confusing city of Venice!) I had read that this park was a big hit with tourists and wasn&acute;t really planning to visit, as I prefer to avoid the typical toursity places. I&acute;m so glad we decided to take the time to explore the park a bit. I actually wish we had more time.\\n\\nThe park is beautiful and well manicured. There is a lovely rose garden, a separate park within a park, the water area was HUGE and amazing.\\n\\nIn the late afternoon we saw many families \"dando un paseo\" on their way home from picking the kids up at school intermingled with the tourists. I was very surprised by how much I enjoyed Parque del Retiro. Amazing in every way and the gold leaf covering majority of the ceiling was stunning with all the art and pictures etc. Free admission with couple of options inside. Long queue but moved quickly. Found it very annoying the number of tourists taking pictures when there was at least 40 signs saying no pictures. Would loved to have taken some snaps but respected rules and thoughts these should have been overseen better. Well worth time and effort. My husband and I saw Carmen at La Fenice a couple of weeks ago. It was played with a modern twist and it was very good (we have seen the classic version a few times). We had very good seats on the parterre but unless you are very high, all the seats look very good. Remember to buy your tickets in advance from home! We heard people trying to get tickets on the same day and it was sold out, even in October. This was Peggy Guggenheim&acute;s personal residence on the Grand Canal in Venice. Her father died when the Titanic sank in 1912. Peggy was only 13 at the time, so she didn&acute;t get her inheritance until she turned 21 in 1919. She inherited about $2.5 million (=$34 million in today&acute;s dollars). She moved to Venice in 1948, where she lived, and collected modern art, until her death in 1979. The museum houses works of Pollack, Picasso, Kandinsky and many others. I knew very little about modern art before visiting, but I enjoyed it very much. I definitely recommend. Do the tour of the Doges place, you get a great tour of the prison which leads you inside of the bridge and you get a great view out.',\n",
              " 'On all of our motor trips south, we always look forward to a visit to Ellis Nuts - great pecans, lots of samples of new flavors, and before we leave, we usually get an ice cream cone to go!\\n\\nThere are picnic tables out front for traveling families = we have enjoyed them = and friendly folks inside the store. Unique outside to the building. Very ornate inside. Worth a visit whilst visiting the main central area even if only for 15-20 minutes. Very imperial building and typically Viennese so well worth a visit. Lovely gardens and easy to find in the city centre. Impressive building from the front and then even more impressive at the back. Well worth taking the time to visit. Not too busy or queues. There is a horse and trap ride around the gardens. Would highly recommend. Definitely well worth a visit to the zoo at the back of the Schoenbrunn Parkland. See the pandas, penguins and polar bears. Lovely gardens to walk around. Great atmosphere. Well worth a visit. Good value for money and a whole range of rides to suit all tastes and budgets. Great views from the top of the big ferris wheel. Log flumes closed whilst we were there but great selection and not too busy. This piece of architectural history is gem in the center of Vienna. Just steps away from the famous Stephansplatz you can predine with maybe the best cocktails and service in the area.The interiour is original from the early 1900s and there is of course possible to have drinks outside when the weather allows.\\nEnjoy :o) 5 hours isn&acute;t enough time to see everything, but the collections are excellent and the information signs next to each painting include a wealth of contextual historical detail.',\n",
              " 'A real surprise which reminds us of the importance of one of the key fundamentals of democracy - freedom of speech and a free press. We ended up spending more than 5 hours there and only left because we were running out of time to get somewhere else. It is a fantastic resource for school children (of which there were a few when we there), but also many points of interest for adults including the FBI exhibit, the various film pieces in the large and small theatres, the Berlin Wall, the Pultizer Prize winning photographs, the 9/11 exhibition - which is just heartreaking - the view of the Capitol Building from the 6th floor terrace and so many other highlights.\\n\\nOh - and the lunch was great in the cafe also. Lots of choice and well organised.\\n\\nDon&acute;t miss it. This church is simply magnifique. It is not dark and morbid looking like St. Peter&acute;s interior. It is much lighter inside and the marble on the walls and floor are a warm color of cream that is very inviting and the lights , when turned on make the place even more warmer.\\n\\nI will always have a soft spot for this Basilica. It is grand with gold inflected frescoes or mosaic art or whatever, but never overkill a la Borgia. Back then Popes were murderous, vindictive, greedy, conniving, etc. The history of Catholicism is so horrendous. So when I see/think of St. Peter&acute;s I think about massive corruption and can&acute;t reconcile that with the way simple and good way people are raised now as Catholics. The Vatican City Basilica is representative of all the corruption back in the day with bribery, wealth, gold this and that. So happy our present Pope is simple. Dupont Circle is an upscale neighborhood with a diverse selection of restaurants and a trendy vibe. There are some interesting shops but fewer than I would&acute;ve expected and a number of hotels in the area. The metro stop is on the red line which means one generally has to connect to go most places and I feel the DuPont circle area is a bit remote for tourists.\\n\\nI&acute;ve been to DC many times and stayed a few weeks in DuPont Circle this summer on business. It&acute;s nice but there are plenty of similar areas in DC. Just down the road is Georgetown which has far more to offer and a short distance the other direction is Logan Circle which has almost as much to offer as DuPont but none of the notoriety.\\n\\nThere were a fair number of foreign tourists at the boutique hotel at which I stayed and they always seemed exhausted from the long trek between the Circle area and the main tourist sites down on the Mall.\\n\\nOverall, the Circle is probably a great place to live, although it could use a closer grocery store than the Safeway down on Corcoran lest one be gouged constantly by the prices at CVS, and it&acute;s a nice place for a short visit but probably not the best choice for tourists looking to do the main DC sights. It was freezing so we only stayed for a few minutes, however, the grounds are beautiful and they still had the 50 Christmas trees that represent each state so we were able to take a peak at them! There was a decent crowd taking pictures and the guards were on point! The Julia Child&acute;s exhibit was great. It showed items in her original kitchen and information on food and its history. The rest of the museum was boring and uneventful. Part of the museum is under construction and there&acute;s not much more to see. No need to go back anytime soon.... beautiful especially in the evening time when the word reflection takes on a special meaning with the Monument clearly seen in the evening lighting Liked everything from the moon capsule to Charles&acute; flight aircraft ---we did miss the shows due to the short time on hand but did enter a few of the aircrafts etc where hands on exhibits were available Located farthest from the bus stops --more directions would have been appreciated\\n\\nNice to see all names in a flawless design --great monument Went on a very hot and humid Sunday afternoon. Been to London, Minneapolis, Chicago zoos among others. This is by far the best we&acute;ve seen and it has a free entrance. If you are a member of the Smithsonian you receive 10% off on any purchases made in their stores. Had plenty of benches and shade along with misters throughout. Unique animals and beautifully landscaped living areas for them too. Loved the way art work was tied into the various animal areas. The Smithsonian does a top notch job of educating wherever they can. Loved the carousel and especially the orangutan areas throughout the zoo. They have the freedom to travel above the zoo. Try to go through the whole zoo--you won&acute;t be disappointed. The Amazonia exhibit is stunning. Had birds that you could go up to in that habitat. Very, very excellent zoo. We saw this memorial during an On Board Night Tour. The white granite was dazzling. It is a beautiful memorial any time of day, but especially at night. Thomas Jefferson&acute;s quotes inside and the sheer size of it are very impressive. No trip to Washington, DC is complete without visiting Lincoln&acute;s Memorial. It is so inspiring and amazing. We loved seeing it at night. A must see. We saw this during an On Board Night Tour. So glad our tour guide gave us a thorough explanation of this memorial before we arrived. There is a lot of symbolism and information in this memorial about FDR&acute;s four terms. It was spread out and near the Dr. Martin Luther King Memorial. We thought it was one of the most fascinating of all the memorials. We took the 3 hour night tour (7:30 p.m.-10:30 p.m.) of the monuments. It was extremely beautiful. Although we didn&acute;t have a lot of time at each monument, we saw most of them within the time allowed and it was perfect for us. Our 9 year old also enjoyed it, however, it was pretty late for her at the end. Nick, our tour guide was exceptional, informative and very, very helpful. We needed to catch the Metro train to Bethesda, and because it was getting late (a few stragglers on the tour made it so) he quickly ordered a taxi for us after we saw the Lincoln Memorial and told the taxi driver where to take us so we wouldn&acute;t miss the Metro. We HIGHLY RECOMMEND this tour, especially during the summer when heat can be a real issue. You won&acute;t be burned or nearly as worn out by taking a night tour. They also provided free COLD water on the bus and it was a great tour. Nick did a fantastic job. I only went here for 5 reasons: I needed a toilet, I needed food, it was free, itвЂ™s the most famous of the Smithsonians, and it featured in Night at the Museum 2. I knew beforehand that I wouldn&acute;t like it as I have no interest in air or space, coupled with the fact that it was bursting to the seams with people, especially children running everywhere. My other major disappointment was that the only thing to eat in their cafeteria was McDonalds. McDonalds must be rubbing their greedy little palms with glee whilst dollar signs are flashing in their eyes. Imagine having the monopoly on this place? Lining their bank vaults and expanding the waistlines of the future generation. Shame on you Smithsonian for allowing this to happen!!!\\n\\nThat being said, all of my moans and groans are the delights of the young. It is truly an awesome exhibition space and there are so many things for the children to do. I imagine it&acute;s every child&acute;s dream to be here and to top it all off, they can have McDonalds too. Therefore...a great day out for the kids, but sadly not for me at all. I was here at the end of July, so the court was &acute;off duty&acute; for the holidays. If it is in session, then it would be well worth queuing for the public gallery in the morning to sit in on a case.\\n\\nThe building itself is beautiful: marble, decorative and somewhat imposing. It fits in perfectly with its neighbours: Capitol building and Library of Congress. In fact, they are so close together, itвЂ™s probably worth planning to visit all 3 on the same day.\\n\\nDuring the summer recess, the court offers lectures every hour (check the website for times) whereby you get to sit in the courtroom and a docent delivers an informative speech about the history and logistics of the court and its function; and the architecture of the building.\\n\\nThe inside of the building is just as beautiful as the outside with marble features, busts of previous Justices; and &acute;gold&acute; plated doors. The spiral staircase is simply stunning. The film showing in the theatre is also well worth viewing as it gives you an insight into the work of the Justices with commentary by them. It also reveals architectural details that you may not have noticed.\\n\\nYou can leave by the front steps (which felt thrilling - justice had been served!) First of all, book your slot online in advance, especially at busy times of the year. I chose the 3:15pm slot thinking that 2 hours would be enough, I only completed the 4th floor (the 1st one) in an hour so wish IвЂ™d factored in more time.\\n\\nBeing British, the Holocaust was very close-at-hand to us, plus I&acute;ve been to the Holocaust Museum in Amsterdam, so I was intrigued by what an American institution could do with this valuable and sombre piece of history. I wasn&acute;t disappointed.\\n\\nYou follow a directed &acute;journey&acute; through the museum starting on the 4th floor which starts with the end of the 1st World War and the start of Hitler and the Nazi party. From then on the displays, information, artwork, models, photographs, artefacts and film clips take you on a deeply moving and sad journey through time. I found the displays well thought out and clear to understand and learnt even more about The Holocaust. I literally read and looked at everything on the 4th floor which took me an hour. When it was time to go down to the 3rd floor, I felt myself exhaling loudly; this is how much the exhibit affected me.\\n\\nI wouldn&acute;t recommend this for younger children; however we ALL have to learn from what happened in Nazi Germany so that it never, ever happens again. The top tip for this one is to book a ticket way in advance on line for a small fee. If you canвЂ™t do that, then youвЂ™ll need to queue for tickets early in the morning.\\nThe monument is not the most impressive and ornate, but I think that its simplicity speaks volume.\\nTo get to the top, you take an elevator with a guide who explains the history and architecture. Once at the top, you get the most amazing views of North, South, East and West вЂ“ all of the other iconic buildings can be seen from this vantage point. It was especially great to see The White House from here. The organisers make it so that itвЂ™s not too crowded at the top and therefore you can easily take that amazing picture.\\nYou have to take some steps down to the next level where there are exhibits and then take the elevator back down to the ground floor. On the way back down, the guide dims the lights and slows the elevator so that you can see the inscriptions from sponsors on the stones inside the tower.\\nThe whole visit took about 30 minutes and itвЂ™s a great visit to combine with The Mall or The Holocaust Museum as they are both nearby. A long walk from the Washington Monument? Depends on what you consider long. ItвЂ™s about 30 minutes max, but ... the sights on the way are great: via the World War II memorial or the Vietnam Memorial - both worth visiting.\\n\\nI came from the WW2 memorial and was able to get a perspective of the monument and experience the reflecting pool (which is why it&acute;s there!)\\n\\nIt was a boiling hot evening, so i took plenty of water, but there are lots of water fountains around the tidal basin park to top up. I arrived at 6:30pm and the place was still buzzing with tourists (coaches were spewing them out every 30 minutes). However, this did not spoil my experience in any way; in fact, it enhanced it: to experience the sight with so many other people from across the globe. And do you really want that &acute;perfect&acute; picture? You can get that in a travel brochure. Surely you want вЂ\\x98yourвЂ™ picture, reflecting your experience.\\n\\nThe statue of Lincoln is seated inside and I&acute;m still marvelling at the fine sculptured detail: the wisps of hair, the fold in the trouser leg etc. It&acute;s just as you imagine it from the movies. I had lots of opportunities to take pictures and I also noted that there&acute;s a free Park Ranger tour available - the latest tour left there at 8pm.\\n\\nWhen you leave, you get a stunning view of the Washington Monument and the reflecting pool. You can tell that they&acute;d really thought about this in their planning!!! We took the champagne tour via Living Social for $15 per person. The regular price is supposedly $30 per person. I would say that $15 per person is the MAX that this visit is worth. $30 would be a total rip off.\\n\\nSo, this is a really unusual place. Essentially, someone took 5 typical DC row houses, put them together and called it a \"mansion\". It is a really big facility-- I&acute;ll give them that. It&acute;s a combination tourist attraction/event venue/hotel/ flea market/used book fair. Eclectic defines this place.\\n\\nAs others have said, EVERTHING is for sale-- and there sure is a lot of stuff! I means, EVERYWHERE. I don&acute;t know how you really could stay in this \"hotel\"-- there&acute;s no surface that isn&acute;t covered in stuff! Every inch is covered! Books, dolls, hats, china, old board games, bells, air planes, statues, candles, chairs, tables, furniture, books, butterflies, tvs (in one room there was a tv sitting on top of a tv!), barber chairs, lamps-- everything. Just stuff! EVERYWHERE!!! And it&acute;s all really expensive! Did I mention books? There are books all over the place. Oh, and in one room, there were 3 old guys just sitting there playing guitars.\\n\\nThe rooms are all decorated in some loose theme, from log cabin to Teddy Roosevelt to Rosa Parks. The bedrooms seem to mostly have bath facilities in the \"suite\" and many seemed to have their own kitchens.\\n\\nI cannot even begin to imagine staying in this schizophrenic place. With all the weird dolls and other items, I fear that I&acute;d have terrific nightmares! Besides that, the whole place is a maze. God forbid you come home drunk or there&acute;s a fire, you would never be able to find your way in or out.\\n\\nI don&acute;t know, maybe I just didn&acute;t get it, but it seemed to be a really bizarre place to me. It smelled weird and I just didn&acute;t get it, I guess. It was fine to waste an hour. With so many things to do in DC, I have no idea how this place can compete. Different strokes for different folks, I suppose. This 1 hour tour was very interesting and fun. The guide was extremely knowledgeable and the program is very well put together and includes videos and audio supplements to the guide&acute;s knowledge. It&acute;s a little off the beaten path. Reservations are necessary, so plan accordingly. We visited the archives several years ago, and it has changed noticeably. The Magna Carta and Articles of Confederation are no longer on the main floor; they are included in a display on the floor below. I did not see the need for all the background information display. It really held up the viewing process. We were instructed by a surly guard to not form lines, and keep moving. With so many people it was impossible to keep moving, as well as impossible to not form a line. Somewhat disappointed that people held up the process. I question the need to have a docent stationed right at the display case, as that is largely what held up the non-line. I really liked the look of the memorial, but really felt like we learned nothing about FDR. Even going to the small \"exhibit\" inside the gift store didn&acute;t teach us (or our 12 year old daughter) much about him. The memorial really does look nice and has some great quotes, but not much in ways of learning about FDR or why he was important. Very nice design of cement with the water/fountains in the center. I guess gigantic tombstones for each state, as well as some countries plus the wall of stars. It is very peaceful area when I visited...I recommend after you walk around, just sit for 15 minutes and take it all in with thought and remembrance...it is humbling. Enjoyed my visit to the air and space museum. The setup is really great with planes hanging from the ceiling from fighter jets of the 30&acute;s and 40s to more recent times, to full size rockets on display. If you have the time, this is worth a few mintues for someinteresting photos of the statues and it is close by from the Lincoln Memorial. Enjoyed the 15th century Italian Gothic section, the Degas exhibit, the Van Gogh paintings to name a few',\n",
              " 'The prismatic spring really delivers spectacular color light show with help of the sun and to be able to capture it whole you will need a really wide lens, but for the best photo you would have to take the picture from the opposite hill as standing at the water level doesn&acute;t really do it&acute;s justice! I was not equipped for hiking, but it would have to be gorgeous to see it from up and above!\\n\\nAnyway it is really amazing to see all this live colors the nature provided us with! We visited Mammoth Hot Springs on our way to Lamar Valley and it was worth it as the \"steps\" are really spectacular to see and offer some very nice photo opportunities - one of the musts in Yellowstone. There is a lot of parking there, even for an RV.\\n\\nSome roadworks were happening when we visited in July so there was a 30min delay on the west road toward Mammoth Hot Springs - take that into account/check visitor center for up to date info.... This was our first Geyser in Yellowstone and we were glad it was as it was worth the wait. The actions happens in intervals around 60-90 minutes so whenever you come, look at the schedule and if you have time to pass enjoy the indoor climatized history lessons, else take a seat and wait for the show! Once it starts for real it will last for some minutes, so enough time to take a lot of photos and just wonder at the mother nature! Good thing to do when arriving to Yellowstone as there is also a general store for things to buy and a gas station... Lamar and Hayden Valleys are your chance to see the animals in action! Visit early in the morning or late afternoon for best chance to not see only the bison. We were VERY LUCKY and Hayden Valley entrance (coming up from south - Yellowstone Lake) served us a full meal in one afternoon! We stopped for some Bison and suddenly on other side of the road there were many Elks! Bisons started to cross the road a minute later Elk started to \"scream\" and there was Grizzly HUNTING THEM....WHAT A SCENE! We were shocked to see all that in a couple of minutes. Elks escaped the Grizzly over the road (what a show that was for everybody on the road) and maybe some 3-5 minutes later Grizzly run over the road after the Elk. We were so thrilled to see all of that! But that was not all for us on that day! Just 20 minutes before on a road to Mt. Washburn we saw some ranger lights and a \"traffic jam\", BEHOLD -> Black bear with two cubs!!!! Rangers were chasing them away from the road! Again we were soooooooo lucky!\\n\\nBut what is the best, is the point that the Black bear was AGAIN THERE on the same spot the next day! So it is worth to drive Lamar&Hayden Valley roads up&down at least 2-4 times and you will probably get lucky to be blessed with a real wild bear! If you enter the Yellowstone park anywhere else but at the north entrance (you probably are) it is a bit of a drive to go to Lamar Valley, but YOU HAVE TO GO THERE as Lamar & Hayden Valley are the places to see the animals. The right time to visit is of course very early (we like to sleep...so no for us) or very late (we were staying at the RV Park by the Lake so also a no no) as animals tend to be more active then. We were in Lamar Valley at around 3-4PM and we still saw huge amount of Bison and when we were just about to turn around coming to the end of Valley....boom....GRIZLY!!! In two days we saw Grizzlies on both of them! But this is really huge amount of luck as you have to be on the right spot at the right time - shortly if you see many many people stopping there is a big chance that it is a bear! Breathtaking view with a waterfall on one side and beautiful valley on the other, just excellent! If you are there for photography make sure the light is right as the difference can be night&day! We were there on a light cloudy day and the light was so different every 5 minutes that I really could play around with the photos. I would certainly recommend afternoon/sunset time and harsh noon sun can really ruin it for you... Wonderfully laid out platform in a curvilinear fashion allows maximum people to view the awesome phenomenon without straining oneself ---the wait is really killing but once it starts spurting it is just overwhelming ---and you are never prepared for the fact that it goes on and on and on !! This is a good drive to see geysers without getting out of your car. If you do get out though and walk along the boardwalk trail, you will be disappear into the steam! Fascinating. The boardwalk tour of the lower terrace is really fascinating even though Minerva is not behaving as she looks in pictures. The key to enjoying the walk is to walk down from the upper terrace parking lot (it helps if you are traveling in two cars). I spent one day just staying close to Old Faithful so that I got to be outside when it went off four different times in one day! The spray and steam was different each time which was just fascinating to me. Even in October, the benches around it were packed between 10 am and 4 pm but few people were there early in the morning or at dusk. One night, we were lucky enough to see a coyote cross in front of it just before dusk. Another day, a buffalo took a nap in its thermal field. We enjoyed this drive so much that we did it two days in a row! It is short but truly spectacular! We stopped at the swimming hole the second trip and walked down the steps to get closer to the water. Some boys thought about swimming but backed out. Yellowstone Lake is gorgeous in early October. We enjoyed our drive along its shoreline....the blue of the water with the snow-capped mountains behind it. Artist Point is an easy, paved walk that takes you to a great viewpoint of the falls and the Grand Canyon of Yellowstone. It is truly beautiful and worth the effort to see this vista. When I visited the Grand Prismatic Spring, I just got glimpses of it...enough to see the colors and know it is special. However, between the steam and the wind, I don&acute;t believe I got any good pictures of it. It is interesting to see the geysers in the upper basin but it is also just as interesting to see Old Faithful across the way. It is a pretty walk to the geyser basin. We had a stray buffalo cross the path right in front of us on our walk. The Grand Canyon of Yellowstone was truly amazing. There are lots of turnouts and walks to see it from different viewpoints. Take advantage of these and enjoy the scenery. This is an area of active geysers and mudpots. It is a vast area of walkways and it can be very hot walking around - so if you have walking difficulties do not attempt. But it is worth the effort as it is one of the most unique areas in the world. Fantastic views - you will not believe how dramatic and beautiful the views are. A must visit in Yellowstone! Loved this valley where you will see buffalo, bears, possibly wolves, elk and fantastic scenery. Visit early evening before sunset to see the animals. An area not to be missed when visiting Yellowstone. Nice hike down steep switchback trail and hundreds of stairs to the waterfalls. Highly recommend seeing it. Good exercise, great views. Warning signs state it is \"extremely strenuous\" so what does that mean? ---It is steep. Going back up is work. It is totally do-able for a 57 year old weekend warrior but tiring. Living at sea level and suddenly exercising in the high mountain thin air meant we had to take a couple breaks on the way back up. Really pretty, do unless you are in poor physical condition.',\n",
              " 'Fabulous day hike to May Lake, and beyond to Mount Hoffman. Less than 1.5 miles from trailhead parking to lake, about 3 miles to the top of the mountain, one way distances. Mount Hoffman is the geographical center of Yosemite NP, pick a clear day, go early before afternoon haze (or smoke in fire season) make views less clear.\\n\\nYes you CAN swim in this lake, just not in certain areas where there are water line tubes catching water from the lake for drinking and cooking use at the High Sierra Camp. Right in front of the camp is OK, and anything on the other side of the lake from the camp is OK too. There is a section of high rocks at the west end of the lake that is nice for jumping into deep cold water. (Some websites out there still reflect old rules of no swimming at all, that has changed in recent years.)\\n\\nDo NOT book a wilderness permit for this campground! It is crowded, it is noisy, it is too close to the road to be a back country experience of any kind. It is one small step (actually 1.2 miles of steps, but that&acute;s not far enough) from car camping, large groups carry cases of bottled beer and all the frills up the trail and stay up all night partying. The staff at the High Sierra Camp work for the park concession service, and do not care what happens in the campground. There is rarely a Yosemite wilderness ranger in the area, and when they are there they stay in the tent cabins at the camp. Do NOT stay at this campground!\\n\\nThe HSC is probably OK, it is the easiest chance for someone who cannot manage a longer hike to have some nature experience. But I prefer one (any!) of the other HSC locations to this one.\\n\\nThe trail to Mount Hoffman is not maintained, be prepared to search around for it a bit in places. You are above the tree line, get an early start, wear a hat, take lots of water. I like the Merced Grove hike, it&acute;s more of a walk really, only 3 miles round trip, but you can turn it into something bigger if you want to.\\n\\nFrom the parking area down to the green gate, where you make a left and head downhill into the grove, you will notice an old road trail that continues straight on. You can use this to create a loop hike, here&acute;s how.\\n\\nTake that left at the green gate, go visit the Merced Grove of Giant Sequoias, and check out the historic Superintendent&acute;s cabin too. Then continue on, you will cross a stream (or dry gully depending on time of year) and then the trail goes up again and intersects with a forest service road. Go right on this road and follow it until it joins back up a the green gate, making an approximate 4 mile loop hike. I love the Wapama Falls hike at Hetchy in autumn, winter and early spring. I find it a bit too hot in the peak of summer, there is very little tree cover or shade along the trail. It can be windy, and much cooler in morning and late afternoon, so layering your clothing is a good idea.\\n\\nThe Wapama Falls trail leaves from the dam at Hetch Hetchy and is about 5 miles round trip. It is not difficult at all, a steady rolling up and down topography. Only the last bit as you drop down towards the bridge below the falls is a little steep, granite steps and few switchbacks. There are rock areas along the trail near the bridge perfect for a picnic lunch break, and even some places to get out of the sun or the wind.\\n\\nWatch your step, on cool or misty days there are adorable red newts who want to share the path with you, they are precious and want protecting from your boots so do keep an eye out for them. And from late spring to early fall there may be snakes on the path, and they are not so good about sharing the trail with you...snakes, it had to be snakes!\\n\\nThere are places along the road to Hetch Hetchy where the Rim Fire took itвЂ™s toll on the landscape. Shades of grey are still the predominant color scheme in some areas along the Wapama Falls hike, but to my eye even the burnt areas have beauty in their own way. Abundant beauty in fact, tree stumps with shapes that resemble the imaginary animals of bedtime stories. Jet black charcoal that glistens in the morning dew or afternoon misty clouds. Manzanita bark burnished by the fire to an even deeper shade of red than usual. The sight of the damaged forest that I love brings much sadness, the worst hit areas bring tears. But there, in between the remnants of what used to be, are many bright green sprouts of new life. Hetchy will once again be a bounty of wildflowers, soon.\\n\\nCritters? Yes! On my latest hike with friends, we saw a golden eagle, two hawks, and several very large ravens soaring overhead. At dawn and dusk there are bats, in fact Hetchy is home to 17 species of bat. And this is bear country, always be bear-aware when hiking at Hetchy. I got used to almost always seeing at least one bear on the Wapama hike, usually a family, but since the Rim Fire IвЂ™ve only seen one bear one time. Hopefully they will come back into the area soon, as the foliage starts to revive.\\n\\nThe OвЂ™Shaughnessy Dam is a place of interest, with historical markers and information displays, and there is a small picnic area near the parking area, and if you are traveling with children they will love the walk thru the wet (puddles!) and somewhat spooky tunnel. There are bathrooms near the parking area too. This is not a good hike for pets, they arenвЂ™t even supposed to walk across the dam let alone on the trail.\\n\\nRock climbing and backpacking is very popular in the Hetchy area. Kolana Rock is over 2,000 feet tall, it is a Peregrine Falcon breading area so has posted closures during some parts of the year. Many place names come from the Miwok tribes, there have been people in Hetch Hetchy Valley for over 6,000 years. Tueeulala Falls is about 880 feet tall and has two main drops, the first being about 600 feet, it is only about 3 miles round trip from the parking area. Wapama Falls is approximately 1,080 feet tall and comes down in a series of drops, it is fed by Falls Creek which is a tributary of the Tuolumne river. Rancheria Creek is a 13 mile round trip day hike, there is a backpacker campground near there, be sure to have a permit and bear canister. The water and habitat of the Hetchy area is protected, humans are not allowed to come in contact with the waterways at all.\\n\\nLooking for something tougher? Try the Poopenaut Valley trail, a trek I fondly refer to as the hike from hell. Very fondly, I canвЂ™t wait to do this hike again, in spite of the slippery footing on the steep bit near the road, and those blasted little black gnats that seem to live in all seasons and want to land on your eyeball. The trail takes you right down to the Tuolumne river banks, below the dam. The pond on the other side of the Tuolumne River at Poopenaut Valley is a breeding ground for rare and endangered species, I like to admire it from up on the road and upper trail. Put this hike on your to-do list too! A nice thing about Mariposa Grove is that the trees are quite close to the parking area. Another nice thing is that when that easy accessibility means crowds of people, there are lots of other trails that are much less traveled which will give you a true nature experience among the giant sequoia trees. This is the largest grove of Giant Sequoias in Yosemite, it is near the south (Highway 41) entrance to the park. There are 2 other Giant Sequoia groves in Yosemite, near the northwest (Highway 120) entrance to the park and the Tioga Road junction at Crane Flat. But if you can visit the Mariposa Grove, it is the one to see.\\n\\nI like the Outer Loop Trail on the northeast side of the grove for going in/up, and I always make sure to go all the way to the Wawona Point for the view of the meadow below and surrounding tree covered hills and granite expanses. It&acute;s a perfect spot for a picnic lunch in the sun, or there is shade along the trail just below the point when it is hot out.\\n\\nAfter lunch, I like to take my time visiting the trees of the Upper Grove by continuing on the Outer Loop Trail until I come to the Telescope Tree, then I turn downhill on the trail to the museum (and restrooms). From the museum, I continue down along the Sequoia Walk past other \"named\" trees like the Faithful Couple and the Clothespin Tree, and finally visit the most famous trees of the Lower Grove such as the California Tree and the Grizzly Giant.\\n\\nIf you get away from the most heavily used trails in the center of the grove, you may see some wildlife. I&acute;ve seen quite a few deer, and recently a Pileated Woodpecker hard at work making lots of noise. Once a few years ago, I saw a bear in the distance. And of course squirrels and chipmunks are always ready to greet you with a scolding sound.\\n\\nIf you go really early in the morning, or late in the afternoon, you may find a place to park. Even in winter, this is a popular hiking area, the trees are world renowned. Otherwise you must take the shuttle bus from the Wawona General Store / Visitor Center area, this is especially true in summer season. The Chilnualna Falls hike is about 8 ВЅ miles round trip, and is a steady climb the whole way to the falls. ItвЂ™s not really steep, just all uphill with a series of long switchbacks and some granite stairs as you near the falls. This is a great hike, with views well worth the effort, I recommend it and would do it again. I did it in winter, there was a little ice and snow towards the top, I took my strap on boot cleats and was glad I had them. It&acute;s low enough elevation that it is accessible almost all year long, it would be great in spring and early summer, the creek is often dry in late summer and fall.\\n\\nWhat I really liked about the Chilnualna Falls trail was the constantly changing perspective and view. Much of the hike is southern exposure, but the trail bends back on itself often so you face in different directions as you go along. There are places where you can see down to Wawona Meadow and up to Wawona Point, and at several spots you are looking towards a large granite dome expanse that I think is Buena Vista peak. And some of the trail offers glimpses of whatвЂ™s to come, towards the trail ahead, the creek and falls. Plus the trail winds in and out of tree cover, mostly oak and pine, so you get some sun but also some shade, a perfect combination no matter what time of year. At times you go away from the creek, and lose the sound of water running over boulders, but then the trail turns back on itself and the music of the creek welcomes you back. I saw two Pileated Woodpeckers while on this hike, neat!\\n\\nAfter a series of granite steps, all of a sudden you round a corner and see the upper falls, with cascades and pools below it lined by rock shelf areas perfect for a picnic lunch in the sun. There are places further along, towards the top of the falls, which would offer shade in the summer. The lower falls is hard to see, you get glimpses of it from the trail but youвЂ™d have to go off trail before the granite steps to see into the narrow canyon and get a full view of the lower falls. I tried to see it from the top, but didnвЂ™t want to get too close to the edge especially since there was ice and snow. ItвЂ™s quite a sudden drop, IвЂ™d stay back in summer too.\\n\\nI hit the trail right about 10am, waiting long enough for the sun to be on much of the trail, but early enough to be back down well before dusk. Hiking the trail in winter, with short days, you would want to allow time and keep up a good pace.\\n\\nTrail head parking is on Chilnualna Falls Road, just before the road ends at the bridge. You drive east/up CFR from Highway 41, the turn is near the Wawona General Store road (but not the same turn!), past \"the Redwoods\" until you come to the toilet and parking on the right. The trail head is a short walk up the road on your left. Put yourself on this trail and you will be wowed. It&acute;s gorgeous. Bring your camera. You need to wear a descent pair of shoes and be ready to climb a few steps, but anybody can do it. If you want the perfect family photo in from of Half Dome, this is where you want to frame it. It&acute;s a good drive out of the Valley (30 minutes?) however. It&acute;s probably worth it, though! Yosemite is more satisfying if you&acute;re willing to get out of the car and get into the nature. How about climbing half dome rather than staring at it from distant scenic points? You can do it. You need to plan in advance (6 months?) and apply for a permit and also get a place to stay nearby. We camped out in Curry Village tents. The trail to half dome starts right outside your tent. It was a 12 hour hike. You have to be in descent shape, but not superb shape. It&acute;s an amazingly beautiful hike and the feeling of accomplishment is unmatched after it&acute;s done. Bring lots and lots of water and a few snacks for the long hike. I&acute;d also recommend a walking stick/hiking poles for the down portion. Good times.']"
