# Travel-Destination-Recommendation-System
 A travel destination recommendation system serves as a valuable      tool for the tourist to plan his trip. In this project I have will be building a model that will assess a new       traveler's personality, age, and travel preferences against those      of existing travelers to suggest the best places for them to go. 
 
Technologies:

I used the Spark framework as its in-memory processing capability makes it easy to deal with data of this volume.

Python programming language.

Pyspark-which supports Python with Apache Spark.

I used Python machine learning libraries(Sklearn). Its goal is to make practical machine learning scalable and easy.
